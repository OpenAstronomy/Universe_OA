It can peer back into primordial times to show images of how the universe looked like around a quarter of a billion years after the Big Bang when the first stars and galaxies started to form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation, a dreaded 10-letter word(just counted the number of letters😅) that brings stress and anxiety in everyone from a small kid to a golden-ager(sounds so much better than ‘old-person’ doesn’t it!!). The Cambridge dictionary defines evaluation &lt;em&gt;(noun)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ɪˌvæl.juˈeɪ.ʃən, &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;strong&gt;“ the process of judging or calculating the quality, importance, amount, or value of something”. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Evaluations bring the best or worst out of people. I work better under pressure, I am one of those guys who cannot work until the room is on fire😂(I have a better phrase but it doesn’t quite qualify as PG-13😜).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluations although simple(the procedure) in GSoC are a big deal as they determine if you get (cue the Heavenly choir sound effect) &lt;strong&gt;the monthly stipend&lt;/strong&gt;🤑, just kidding, they determine if the student will be allowed to continue their projects. There are three &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;main &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;evaluations, one after each month to quantify if the project achieves the goals that it intended to and if the time was utilized most efficiently for the greatest possible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand procedural information is pretty boring so let’s directly jump to the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Google FooBar Challenege&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FvygSOchRZWfDLrq4QB9GQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looks like an invitation from a secret society!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened at around 9:00 am on 9th of June, I had pulled an all-nighter and was half-asleep, finding ways to optimize stingray, when on typing _________ my browser window pivoted, the above image unfolded, my eyes widened, heartbeat skyrocketed, I looked in awe at my screen and then blinked 100 times, washed my face to truly confirm what I was seeing was true. &lt;br&gt;
It was the GOOGLE FOOBAR CHALLENGE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FooBar challenge is a coveted, hidden challenge, a special invitation that is only sent to a selected few(makes me feel like James Bond😜). FooBar is Google’s secret hiring challenge. Google uses this to hire some of the best developers around the globe which they think can be a good match for their organization. &lt;br&gt;
Google sends an invitation based on one’s search history and problem-solving related keyword searches. If hidden magic in the Google search algorithm chooses you, you may receive an invitation for Google Foobar(makes me feel like Harry Potter😂).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without thinking twice I instantly clicked &lt;em&gt;‘I want to play’. &lt;/em&gt;A black screen with a command-line interface greeted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sxh-YA_0437rxf5lu4r8mA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objects we ardently pursue bring little happiness when gained; most of our pleasures come from unexpected sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FooBar challenge is essentially an online, time-bound Competitive Programming(CP) challenge with 5 rounds of increasing difficulty, each round having a different number of questions. &lt;br&gt;
To spice things up (both in terms of interest and difficulty) Google has a storyline, progressing through the challenges you are asked for a friend who you’d like to refer for the challenge and eventually some personal details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FooBar proved to be a great learning experience for me as I’m not proficient in CP. I felt that the main aim was not to test the skills and knowledge of an individual but also how quickly they could learn and implement solutions.&lt;br&gt;
To learn more about FooBar you could read this &lt;a href="https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First GSoC Evaluation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vw7I5eOtqMVRWRRLQcJKiw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Summer of Code Dashboard a friend who I only see once every month😂😂&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first evaluations were scheduled from the June 29, 2020 — July 3, 2020. My mentor Matteo and I had finalized on two main deliverables crucial for the foundations of the project. &lt;br&gt;
1. A &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/9d7fa8a76d70df1eeb4501cb7ce701fb8e5bddf0/Benchmarks/Benchmark%20Analysis%20Report%202020%20-%20stingray.pdf"&gt;benchmark analysis report&lt;/a&gt; containing the time and memory benchmarks, profiling results for &lt;strong&gt;all the 31 functions&lt;/strong&gt;(3000+ lines of code)in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/lightcurve.py"&gt;Lightcurve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/powerspectrum.py"&gt;Powerspectrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/crossspectrum.py"&gt;Crossspectrum&lt;/a&gt;, AveragedPowerspectrum and AveragedCrossspectrum classes. &lt;br&gt;
2. Integrating &lt;a href="https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;airspeed velocity&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for benchmarking Python packages over their lifetime into stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark analysis report was a very time consuming yet possibly the most important step of the project. It singled out the functions that were causing the most delay and provided an overall estimate of the performance of stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking was performed in jupyter-notebooks. Data points of sizes ranging from 1,000(1K) to 100,000,000(100M) were used for benchmarking. For basic benchmarking, the %timeit and %memit magic commands were used. Two profilers &lt;a href="http://joerick.me/posts/2017/12/15/pyinstrument-20/"&gt;Pyinstrument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile"&gt;CProfile&lt;/a&gt; were used to profile time and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/filprofiler/"&gt;filprofiler&lt;/a&gt; was used to profile memory use. &lt;br&gt;
The results of the CProfile were saved as a &lt;em&gt;.pstats&lt;/em&gt; file which was then visualized using &lt;a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/"&gt;Snakeviz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot"&gt;gprof2dot&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a graphical viewer and call-graph respectively. &lt;br&gt;
The results of the Pyinstrument and filprofiler were saved as HTML files.&lt;br&gt;
The results of the &lt;em&gt;%timeit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;%memit&lt;/em&gt; magic commands was visualized in an interactive &lt;a href="https://plotly.com/"&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; graph in the jupyter-notebook itself and also saved as an HTML file for easier access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all of this was &lt;strong&gt;535 &lt;/strong&gt;files&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ready for analysis, compiled into a &lt;strong&gt;74-page&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/9d7fa8a76d70df1eeb4501cb7ce701fb8e5bddf0/Benchmarks/Benchmark%20Analysis%20Report%202020%20-%20stingray.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;9 &lt;/strong&gt;new GitHub issues and &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; new Pull Requests(for now, more to come soon).&lt;br&gt;
The functions causing the main slowdown i.e. &lt;em&gt;check_lightcurve, counts_err, cross_two_gtis, sort_counts, join, fourier_cross, rebin_data, rms_error, gti_border_bins, check_gtis, operation_with_other_lc and p_multitrial_from_single_trial &lt;/em&gt;were identified. These were further analyzed line-wise for deeper insights(also included in the document).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q3I5H5d6R8BEj73q7-YuAA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These look beautiful in the picture but analyzing 535 of these is super tedious!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;airspeed velocity is a powerful tool that helps track the performance of a project over time, commit after commit. It is essentially a set of tests that can be run after every commit/change to check if the performance has been altered. It is used by numpy, scipy and astropy. The documentation is very well written(&lt;em&gt;sighs with relief&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;br&gt;
Thus, integrating airspeed velocity was &lt;em&gt;comparatively &lt;/em&gt;easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A brief personal submission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The thing I enjoy the most about GSoC is that just like most of you reading this article, I didn’t know, rather hadn’t even heard the names of all the tools I used and am probably adept at right now. &lt;br&gt;
I start working every day not knowing how to solve the task(often daunting) in front of me or what the day holds. But at the end of the day, I’m confident that I’ve learnt something new. &lt;br&gt;
This excites me and I look forward to every new day working on my GSoC project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out my repository for airspeed velocity below. There is a link on the right side that leads to a webpage which looks relatively empty at the moment, someday hopefully, it will look like &lt;a href="https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/"&gt;numpy’s asv&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/theand9/stingray-benchmarks"&gt;theand9/stingray-benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check the benchmarks I have performed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I would again like to apologize as this blog is going to be astronomically jargon-heavy(pun intended). &lt;br&gt;
Now before you decide to just watch the funny Joey video and go watch more Friends episodes; trust me after reading this 7 minute blog you will gain serious bragging rights. After which you can binge Friends to your heart’s content(I already got my popcorn bowl with me 😉).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Bonding Phase and APE — 17&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/925/1*r3LeWqbDsz2bz-NfL3zadA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Community is about doing something that makes belonging matter”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community, as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary is the “people living in one particular area or people who are considered as a unit because of their common interests, social group, or nationality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin to the communities in the real world, the Open-Source Software community is one of the most diverse and active communities in the world. All Open-Source projects from the Linux Kernel to a niche, newly conceptualized project have several contributors keeping the project alive. &lt;br&gt;
The best part about this online community is that any individual willing to contribute to the project is welcomed irrespective of their caste, creed, gender, race, nationality, level of expertise. &lt;br&gt;
To be a part of a community of zealous, like-minded individuals working towards making the world a better place with software, makes you feel somewhat like a superhero😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of Open-Source is the power of the people &lt;/strong&gt;~ Philippe Kahn&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community bonding phase is probably the most important part of the whole program. A month is given to students to get acquainted with the project community and mentors. Students are expected to get familiarized with the &lt;em&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/em&gt; and other guidelines such as Contributing, Coding, Testing guidelines.&lt;br&gt;
This is an amazing opportunity to not only plan and research more about one’s project but also interact with other students of the same/different organization’s and learn more about their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rzgbbfXrjVV2jcr08x8MUg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;First Contact. The most exhilarating~2700 seconds of my life&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had two calls with my mentor Mr Matteo Bachetti during the community bonding phase. Lucky me, I got a one-to-one introduction to X-Ray Astronomy(with an amazing presentation) from Mr Bachetti himself!!&lt;br&gt;
We discussed the goals, specifics as well as a rough trajectory of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community bonding phase gave me an amazing opportunity to not only associate with my peers from OpenAstronomy but also other organizations. I was particularly interested in a few projects from CERN-HSF as well as other projects from various sub-organizations in OpenAstronomy. &lt;br&gt;
Thank you so much, Siddharth Lal, Biswarup Banerjee, Raahul Singh, Kris Stern, Abhijeet Manhas and Sahil Yadav, Honey Gupta, Prateek Kumar Agnihotri and Pranath Reddy for answering my persistent and often novice-level questions. You guys are awesome!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the community bonding phase, I started working on updating stingray to APE-17(view my PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/469"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It was my first major PR(For all the non-techies out there a Pull Request(PR) is a proposal to implement changes to the main codebase to squash a bug or add a new feature). Looking at the status of the PR changed to “&lt;strong&gt;merged&lt;/strong&gt;” gave me an unprecedented level of gratification. &lt;em&gt;#justprogrammerthings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I will not bore you with the technical aspects of APE-17 but if you wish to learn more about it, here’s a &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/files/4718995/APE17.Update.pdf"&gt;summarized document I created&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;X-ray Astronomy 101 with stingray&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/879/1*EsYpWW63Ui-bHMtjnIHjtQ.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/strong&gt;I am not an expert at X-ray Astronomy, not even by a long shot(Just a month’s experience). I am a Computer Science techie, passionate about space and great at googling stuff 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the part that all of you have been waiting for, the part that will give you the ultimate bragging rights of learning something new, &lt;em&gt;being productive&lt;/em&gt; in these lazy lockdown times, presenting to you&lt;em&gt;(insert drum roll) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;X-ray Astronomy 101 with stingray.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What is stingray? What does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stingray is a community-developed spectral-timing software package in Python for astrophysical data. It provides a basis for advanced spectral-timing analysis with a correct statistical framework while also being open-source.&lt;br&gt;
Stingray provides functionalities such as:&lt;br&gt;
a. Constructing light curves from event data and performing various operations on light curves (e.g. add, subtract, join, truncate)&lt;br&gt;
b. Good Time Interval operations&lt;br&gt;
c. Creating periodograms(power spectra) and cross spectra&lt;br&gt;
and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. So well what does all of this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the abrupt deep dive into the realm of long and daunting words that make zero sense at the moment. But please bear with me for a moment, once we are done with the basic you will truly appreciate the role that stingray plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/1*c_HQHP_uPGD4z6o11j7veg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A time series is a simple graph that can be plotted for any values eg. temperature, rainfall, stock price etc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Time Series:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a sequence of observations recorded at a succession of time intervals. In general, time series are characterized by the interdependence of its values. This means that the value of the series at some time &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt; is generally not independent of its value at, say, &lt;strong&gt;t−1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.&lt;strong&gt; Time Series Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a statistical technique that deals with gaining insights from periodic or stochastic(a fancy way of saying random, aperiodic) time-series data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s learn some astronomical terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*yMWqnSRF06lxoYKptQ4d-A.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;FFT I am looking at you&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Timing Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Many time series show periodic behaviour. This periodic behaviour can be very complex. Spectral analysis is a technique that allows us to discover underlying periodicities by decomposing the complex signal into simpler parts. To perform spectral analysis, we first must transform data from the time domain to the frequency domain. &lt;br&gt;
Hence spectral analysis can be defined as decomposing a stationary time series {&lt;em&gt;xT}&lt;/em&gt; into a combination of sinusoids(sine waves), with a random (and uncorrelated) coefficient; essentially analysis in the frequency domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Good Time Intervals (GTI’s)&lt;/strong&gt;: When observing a stellar object with a satellite, data is accumulated by observing the source with short exposures over time or collecting single photons(light particles) with their arrival time.&lt;br&gt;
While recording observations, there will be times when everything is working perfectly. At other times we might have obstructions from the Earth that hinder our ability to observe the source properly.&lt;br&gt;
Good time intervals (GTIs) are the time intervals where instruments are working well and the source is perfectly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Light Curves&lt;/strong&gt;: Light curves are graphs that show the brightness of an object over a period of time. Images show from the part of an object from where light is emitted. Another piece of information we have about light is the time when it reaches the detector. Astronomers use this “timing” information to create light curves and perform timing analysis. &lt;br&gt;
They are simply graphs of brightness (Y-axis) vs. time (X-axis). Brightness increases as you go up the graph and time advances as you move to the right.&lt;br&gt;
eg. The following lightcurve can be generated with the values from the table on the left. The change in brightness is periodic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*FNFYTegivTDTnsfqis1Tag.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can generate similar light curves for studying any part of the light spectrum eg. X-Rays. The record of changes in brightness that a light curve provides can help astronomers understand processes at work within the object they are studying and identify specific categories of stellar events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/591/0*r2NyyR6RtBfhevGq.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;d.&lt;strong&gt; Spectral Density/Power Spectra&lt;/strong&gt;: The power spectra of a time series {&lt;em&gt;xT} &lt;/em&gt;describes the distribution of power into the frequency components of that signal. When these signals are viewed in the form of a frequency spectrum, certain aspects of the received signals or the underlying processes producing them are revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.&lt;strong&gt; Power Spectral Density Function&lt;/strong&gt;: A Power spectral density function (PSD) shows the number of energy variations as a function of frequency. In other words, it shows at which frequencies are variations strong, weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/582/0*ZYcuX1JdLSPTjPeM.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;f. &lt;strong&gt;Cross Spectra&lt;/strong&gt;: Cross spectral analysis allows one to determine the relationship between two time-series as a function of frequency. Normally, we wish to compare two time-series along their peaks to see if these signals are related to one another at the same frequency and if so, what is the phase relationship between them. Even if two signals look identical we wish to check their periodicity and understand how they are related.&lt;br&gt;
The Cross spectrum is a frequency domain analysis of the cross-correlation (how two lightcurves are related) or cross-covariance(how two lightcurves are related if one of them is linearly transformed eg. shifted in time).&lt;br&gt;
For further reference check this out: &lt;a href="https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/552_Notes_6c.pdf"&gt;https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/552_Notes_6c.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. How does stingray contribute to all of this confusing stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stingray implements all of these complex functions in a single easy to use package. It has various methods and classes such as lightcurve, powerspectrum, crossspectrum.&lt;br&gt;
Stingray also provides a &lt;em&gt;HENDRICS &lt;/em&gt;CLI and &lt;em&gt;dave &lt;/em&gt;GUI interface for abstract analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woohoo!!🎉🎉 you made it through.&lt;br&gt;
Now if all of this intrigues you as much as it did me, you can go through the references mentioned below and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks"&gt;stingray notebooks &lt;/a&gt;that demonstrate the functionality mentioned above or even fork the repository and tinker around with the code yourself(&lt;strong&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;Thinking about it today, it seems like being connected to a continuous 240 V supply of dreams, curiosity, excitement and innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Encyclopedia — Kingfisher’s Book of the Universe" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/289/1*QgW1T6Eenq62-YRAw3ae-g.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;My favourite encyclopedia. In mint condition after 15 years (Thank you mom for not letting me rip off the outer paper cover 😜)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my dreams was to be an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;astronomer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I remember having a lot of encyclopedias on space as a kid(Geek Alert — I have read all my encyclopedias at least 10 times😅 ). I went to NASA once and even built a model telescope (which showed an inverted 20x zoomed image).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
Whenever did an adult ask “&lt;em&gt;beta &lt;/em&gt;what do you want to be when you grow up?” I always replied, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I want to be an Astronomer!!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the hurdle for realizing my childhood dreams was none other than the &lt;em&gt;Indian Education System&lt;/em&gt;(a story for some other time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the present, I am a sophomore pursuing my undergrad in Computer Science with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning(my second favourite area of interest) at Mumbai. &lt;br&gt;
Recently, I stumbled across a term called &lt;strong&gt;Computational Astrophysics, &lt;/strong&gt;which according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/computational-astrophysics"&gt;Nature.com&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;“the study of the phenomena that occur in space using computer simulations. This can involve modelling processes that take place over millions of years, such as colliding galaxies or the slow destruction of a star by a black hole.” &lt;/em&gt;There exists a harmonious amalgamation of &lt;strong&gt;Astrophysics and Computer Science&lt;/strong&gt;(uses ML as well, woohoo!!). I was overjoyed, I felt like I had finally found my calling, life had come around in a full circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“When you have a childhood dream that still burns and tugs at your heart when you’re an adult, you owe it to yourself to pursue and achieve this dream.” — Robert Cheeke&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Summer of Code 2020" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_nxcAB2S0wiyT-KOscvDqA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Viral if you’re reading this. Wouldn’t be inspired to try for GSoC without you. Thanks man!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Summer of Code 2020 — My journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;2020 brought with it bushfires, riots, plane crashes and the most dreaded COVID-19 &lt;em&gt;Coronavirus&lt;/em&gt;. But COVID-19 turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me!! (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned to apply for Google Summer of Code(GSoC; I’m particularly fond of the abbreviation) during my semester break in December. I read about the program, it’s benefits to the Open-Source community, the value it would add to my profile, the unique learning experience it provides, as well as the nitty-gritty of the application process. I won’t lie, it seemed to be pretty intimidating at first, but luckily my seniors who were a part of GSoC’2019 had briefed us about the program(thanks a ton Pujan, Ruturaj, Sahil😁) well in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, I dual booted Ubuntu on my laptop(best decision ever!!), got familiarized with the basics of GitHub and set up IRC and Slack on my laptop(I was already using Slack for another college club).&lt;br&gt;
Now, with the prerequisites out of the picture, I went through the organizations that had consistently been a part of GSoC for the last 5 years. &lt;br&gt;
My skillset mainly includes Python, Data Science and Machine Learning with some experience in Web Development. I searched for organizations which had projects in Python with some exciting applications. I shortlisted CERN-HSF, OpenAstronomy and INCF. During my break, I contributed to a few repositories by fixing a few bugs, spelling-errors, refactoring code and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 18th&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;2020, &lt;/strong&gt;the date when the student projects were going to be announced came faster than I had anticipated. I followed the same approach as I did in December while shortlisting organizations and topics. In addition to the organizations I had shortlisted in December, I looked for new organizations and topics that interested me. Initially, I had a long list of &lt;em&gt;8 topics&lt;/em&gt;(too many!) which then narrowed down to 5 and then finally 2. &lt;br&gt;
One from CERN-HSF and another from OpenAstronomy for a framework called Stingray. I did not qualify the evaluations for the topic at CERN-HSF(tough luck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UjeIIWLdcqMjsRnoi64EYw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;OpenAstronomy and Stingray&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time passed in a blink, and lo and behold it was the 5th of March, 2020. I had barely made any real progress on the Stingray topic. I was constantly juggling my college work, tests and the GSoC project to no avail. Remember, I had mentioned above that COVID-19 turned out to be a boon in disguise for me? here’s why. &lt;br&gt;
My college was shut by the 12th of March, 2020 due to the fear of COVID-19. The last day of the proposal submission was on the 31st of March, 2020. This meant I had 19 whole days(with continuous college work and lectures 🤦‍♂️) to work on the project and submit my proposal for the topic “&lt;em&gt;A lightning-fast stingray: Parallelizing stingray operations to analyze larger-than-memory datasets”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task seemed to be daunting but finally after a lot of coffee, monster energy drinks, sleepless nights and an amazing amount of help and support from my mentor &lt;a href="http://www.matteobachetti.it/about"&gt;Mr Matteo Bachetti&lt;/a&gt;(I was stupefied and scared to approach Mr Bachetti initially after reading his credentials, but Matteo you’re an amazing person!! I look up to you) I finally submitted my &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGL3jqTCHcQyaWwjmU-zCG5qenZsQGSqlnzNB6UcjpE/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; on the 28th of March, 2020(phew!). Now came the hardest phase, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;waiting for the results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Chances to get into GSoC’2020. The odds were stacked against me." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cJkVm-zJ7_hgi_MJfle8-A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The acceptance rate for GSoC in 2020 was 2.398%&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37 days, 11 hours, 30 minutes &lt;/strong&gt;later(approx.) at 11:30 pm on the 4th of May, 2020… the Google Summer of Code website &lt;strong&gt;crashed&lt;/strong&gt;🙄. &lt;br&gt;
It was11:33 pm(believe me, every second passes like an eternity) and I hadn’t received an email and the website was still not active. After &lt;em&gt;60 eternities&lt;/em&gt; the website finally loaded. I carefully typed in my email id and password and as I &lt;strong&gt;clicked enter&lt;/strong&gt;(cue the palpitations, dry mouth, fidgety fingers and the tick-tock of an old clock) &lt;strong&gt;Hallelujah!!&lt;/strong&gt; a dashboard with my topic and my name opened. I was overjoyed, ecstatic, elated, thrilled, jubilant, on the seventh heaven; in short, all the synonyms of the word ‘&lt;em&gt;happiness’&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t describe the emotions racing through me at that moment. &lt;strong&gt;I had just got into Google Summer of Code 2020!! &lt;/strong&gt;I was one of &lt;strong&gt;1199 students&lt;/strong&gt; from the 50,000+ who had registered for the program!!!&lt;/p&gt;
