So as a one-line description, I had to study, implement and integrate a spectral estimation technique, namely the &lt;em&gt;Multitaper Periodogram³&lt;/em&gt; (and its derivatives¹), which are used to analyze astronomical time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Why spectral representations?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before getting into the how of spectral analysis and its estimation, a brief sidenote on the why. Why do we even bother to study the spectral properties of a time series? It turns out, some of the determining characteristics or defining parameters associated with a certain time series are better &lt;em&gt;brought out&lt;/em&gt; in their spectral representations (frequency domain representations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, the power spectral density is a common tool to try and unearth the periodic element(s) in a time series. Such spectral analysis techniques, at their core, are enabled by the Fourier Transform, and if you’d like to gain a better intuitive understanding of it, do check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY"&gt;this awesome video&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GrantSanderson"&gt;Grant Sanderson&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw"&gt;3Blue1Brown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Multi what?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spectral analysis isn’t without its fair share of practical complications, in fact, far from it. But there have been quite a few very effective techniques to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them is &lt;em&gt;tapering (&lt;/em&gt;multiplying the time series with a bell-shaped function), effective in reducing spectral leakage. Tapering a time series as a way of obtaining a spectral estimator with acceptable bias properties is an important concept. The loss of information (contained at the extremes of the time series) inherent in tapering can often be avoided either by prewhitening or by using Welch’s overlapped segment averaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multitaper periodogram is another approach to recover information lost due to tapering. This approach was introduced by Thomson (1982)³ and involves the use of multiple orthogonal tapers, having approximately uncorrelated spectral densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the multitaper method, the data is windowed or tapered, but this method differs from the traditional methods in the tapers used, which are the most band-limited functions amongst those defined on a finite time domain, and also, these tapers are orthogonal, enabling us to average the &lt;em&gt;eigenspectrum&lt;/em&gt; (spectrum estimates from individual tapers) from more than one tapers to obtain a superior estimate in terms of noise. The resulting spectrum has low leakage, low variance, and retains information contained in the beginning and end of the time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tapers used are the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), or, the Slepians (Slepian 1978)⁴.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;A look at the DPSS tapers&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider a time series sampled from an autoregressive process of order 4, AR(4), which has been frequently exemplified in literature¹ in similar contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/657/1*h-k9Xm1CgerMQVIeKbfyOw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A time series sampled from an autoregressive process of order 4.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good way to gain an intuitive understanding of the properties of the DPSS tapers, and how they affect the time series, is to visualize the effect. Given here are the time and frequency domain representations of the tapers and the tapered time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 8 tapers and the corresponding tapered time series⁵.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/645/1*SEG0OEstBuAgP5OqgnS4zA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This showcases the product of a windowing function and a time series quite well. Next let’s have a look at their spectral representations⁵, more specifically, their power spectrum densities (PSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*nvqbaD08gDf1zdh9P2ljqQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For this example, we took the normalized half-bandwidth product to be equal to 4 (NW = 4), resulting in 8 tapers being used. The spectral concentration in the band [-W, W] can then be seen from the plots. (Here N, the number of data points, is 1024, hence, W = 4/N = 0.003906)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a significant increase in the bias of the PSD estimates as the spectral concentration of the tapers worsens. To prevent these estimates with greater biases from affecting the final averaged estimate but still use the variance reductions they bring, we weigh the different estimates according to their spectral concentration (percentage of energy concentrated in the desired frequency band).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be kicked up a notch by using what is called adaptive weighing, which adaptively (duh?!) combines the different estimates, calculating the weights using an iterative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;A brief summary of the Multitaper spectral estimation&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/3f23eb5c2c41460b8793fbc2e6fbc04d/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/3f23eb5c2c41460b8793fbc2e6fbc04d/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summary, by no means, is an exhaustive explanation of the multitapering concept. Further exploration of the topic is highly encouraged. Use the references as the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Final Result&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using all the techniques outlined here, let's see how well can this multitaper periodogram estimate the true spectrum of this auto-regressive process. Also added is the classical periodogram (also sometimes referred to as a naïve spectrum estimator because of its basic estimation process) for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/707/1*7eYiabftab1cYuMpBC4uqA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Here the multitaper estimate uses the adaptive weighting technique and the first 7 DPSS tapers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this functionality is now implemented in &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray"&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt;²&lt;/p&gt;

Such an extended timeline could provide many benefits, such as the ability to work on more complex and sophisticated projects, more time to collaborate and improve, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;First Evaluation&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another noteworthy thing concerning GSoC that happened in the last week was that the results of the first evaluation were declared, and while most cleared it, some didn’t. Although there is little to no need to question their abilities, sometimes life just doesn’t go as planned; it seems easy to say that that’s what the real test is, nevertheless it can quickly become something tricky to cope with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What next?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the “proposed” work has been done, I will now be preparing some tutorials for the newly added functionality and tools, in an attempt to reduce the barrier to experimentation, use, and possible adoption of these new techniques into the workflow of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while this could take a good amount of time if quality is needed, there will surely some be time to play around with other things, but what exactly will end up happening will be answered by time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=b6f9ec014333" width="1"&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210719_1916_dhruv9vats/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Month into GSoC</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210705_2037_dhruv9vats/</link><dc:creator>Dhruv Vats</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s almost been a month since the start of GSoC’s coding period and the work, I’m glad to write, is progressing at a steady and satisfactory rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Developments&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time around, my first ever not-so-meaningless contribution to open-source had just got merged, and I was really happy about it. But what that also did was, get me over the initial anxiety and intimidation I might have been feeling towards open-source. This, I think, has also helped speed things along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I started working on the optional features of my project around 2 weeks ago, I had to scrape the initial implementation because it turned out to be very, very slow and therefore had to be completely replaced with a better and more efficient approach, which was a bit less straightforward. But now, two weeks into experimenting and iterating, a new pull-request has been opened with the newly implemented efficient version of the feature, and while it's still a few minor commits away from its final form, the core functionality works as expected and, if everything goes as expected, which is never a guarantee, a hefty part of my proposal’s objectives will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while this does not guarantee anything, I’d be lying if I said that I am not hoping for something exciting to do as I might have time to try out other things. What exactly, I honestly don’t know, but if I find myself in that minority who actually like what there doing, it’ll be an absolute privilege, which I’m looking forward to and wishing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DvmM4lhclsVa5tIwl5um4A.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Just some pastel colors for you to look at&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Goal&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows might be a very steep change in topic, but is one, that I think lies at the root of many seemingly normal activities. This is just something that has been on my mind lately, and what writing is, if not a tool to better understand yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like an invisible aura is building around me saying that you are at a stage in life where you need to man up, where you should have everything together and figured out, but whenever I try and assess myself in this context, I always, without fail, fell short of it and by a good margin. While the contrasting opposite of this would be saying that I am everything I ever wanted to be and have nothing to work towards, would be outright arrogant and even dangerous, there must be a balance somewhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why should I have it all figured out, what’s even the need? And while statements like these can be argued against using something like, because everyone is doing it, and this is the way, they give the vibes of being in a pipeline you’ve been pushed into and now have no option but to pass through. And this, I think, many will agree, is not a very desirable situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need to progress towards something also spurs off many questions, one of which is “the why ?”. The why, is an oh-so-difficult question to answer that honestly makes me feel frustrated at times, not knowing to what end all the efforts are being put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be argued that this is a ridiculous thing to think about, and one should not set overly optimistic expectations, this, I feel, contradicts the notion of elegance that I somehow have associated with the fundamental workings of the world. If someone asked me to comment on the secrets of the Universe, I’d be very comfortable with using the words elegant and sophisticated, even though I basically know nothing about it? Why? Is this just a desire to find meaning in everything, or is there something else at play?&lt;/p&gt;

Almost Done!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210621_1523_dhruv9vats/</link><dc:creator>Dhruv Vats</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;With only 2 weeks into the coding period, it feels good to say that the bulk of the work associated with the 2 milestones is &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;done. Almost because the newly added functionality is yet to be battle-tested and while there is always room for change and improvements, my focus will be shifting from the main objective to the optional objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Project&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific jargon ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study and interpretation of time-series data have become an integral part of modern-day astronomical studies and a common approach for characterizing the properties of time-series data is to estimate the power spectrum of the data using the periodogram. But the periodogram as an estimate suffers from being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statistically inconsistent (that is, its variance does not go to zero as the number of data samples reach infinity),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Biased for finite samples, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Suffers from spectral leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*5GHLU2O-S9d06amIH5ESBA.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Stingray is a spectral-timing software package for astrophysical X-ray (and other) data.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My project aimed at implementing and integrating a superior spectral estimation technique, known as the Multitaper periodogram, into a Software Package called Stingray, a sub-organization of OpenAstronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Multitaper algorithm uses windows or tapers (bell-shaped functions), which are multiplied with the time-series data before finding its frequency domain estimate. These windows, called the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), help mitigate the problems mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any more technical stuff and this blog will start taking the shape of my proposal, so I’ll leave it here, but for anyone more interested, &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2m2p10en8ygpmz/Proposal.pdf?dl=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Process&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started working on the project in early March, before submitting the proposal, and it initially included writing a wrapper around an external package to make the use of this tool coherent with the rest of the project. While a proof-of-concept implementation was put together, it was later decided to use SciPy to do the grunt work, as it already was a dependency, somewhat changing the initial milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in a way, I was already working on the project before the results were announced and ended up opening a pull request with the newly added method 1 week into the coding period and it got merged a week later, which happened to be fairly early in the GSoC program coding timeline. Perks of open-source?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while there are sure to be improvements and additions in terms of coherency and features, this does give a bit more breathing room and time for experimentation and exploration, and I’ll try and make good use of it, primarily by working on the optional but quite good-to-have features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/578"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the PR.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: nasa.gov&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Google Summer of Code: My Introduction to OpenSource&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I can’t come close to doing justice in explaining OpenSource, I would like to point out just how widespread its use is, and what better example for it than the most successful OpenSource project ever, that is, Linux. As far as statistics are concerned,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;100% of the world’s top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;96.3% of the world’s top 1 million servers run on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;85% of all smartphones are based on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it suffices to say that most people have used OpenSource software one way or the other. But how does that concern me? A budding mind in the computing industry should have some familiarity with OpenSource, is an understatement. And that's where Google Summer of Code comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight from its landing page,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Motivation&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While talking about the intricacies of computing and its sophisticated relationship with science is a rabbit hole as deep as any, let’s talk motivation for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, I believe, is an inherent property of consciousness. This curiosity is most exposed in children, who, if you look for it, are intrigued by almost everything around them and try and understand it better. While this curiosity and the silly questions that come with it are overwhelmed by the problems of the here and now as we grow up, I think it is rather pleasant to visit those silly questions every so often, as the answers to some of them could tick off a line of thought that leads to discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such revelating thought that I had and has stuck with me is when the idea of the vastness of the Universe started sinking in. I know, big words, but bear with me. As philosophical as it may sound, the thought that my existence is just an inconceivable dot on yet another pale blue dot from far away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/290/1*4bvU5y61XMwH8E_wmKLdCw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A photograph of planet Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Voyager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; 1. &lt;/em&gt;Seen from about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles), Earth appears as a tiny dot within deep space: the blueish-white speck almost halfway up the brown band on the right. Source: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;was a comforting one. Why? I don’t know. But one thing this did was reignite my curiosity to better understand the world around me, and my place in it. While the discussion of the latter becomes too philosophical too soon, it is the former for which I’m writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Resistance&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Earth, where sadly all my burdens still exist and I’m mostly consumed in “my little world”, I was quite intimidated by how little I knew, especially by the people on the Internet. While such a comparison is unjustified and foolish, this did become a roadblock that was amplified by this feeling that my work should amount to something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And considering where my career was headed it was time I let go of this feeling and actually start doing stuff. This, I think, is where OpenSource helps in that it has a place for you to contribute to no matter your skill level, while also constantly encouraging you to get better. You just have to put yourself out there, a challenge for someone like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is that Google Summer of Code does an excellent job of bridging the transition between learning stuff and actually doing something with that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I2MgGZwscyP4AjM2LGpYTA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h5&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this idea of me working on discovering stuff in the Universe is still as dreamy as ever, I would jump at an opportunity that would take me a step closer to that, if I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in touch with one of OpenAstronomy’s sub-organizations, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray"&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt;, in February this year and started working on an algorithm used for better spectral estimation of time-series data as I had gained some familiarity with time-series data in my coursework. It was during the time when I was implementing the algorithm that I was given a time-series dataset to play around with. It was observed by an X-ray telescope as individual light photons hit its detector from the gas falling from a star into a black hole as they orbited around each other in a binary system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just awakened the fascinated child inside of me and became the main motivation for working with OpenAstronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to an exciting and different summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Cool Concepts?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a discussion about the Universe, life, and meaning is a thrill, constantly being in a state of mind where one does not lose such perspective is a different feat altogether. This perspective, which among other things, encourages one to ask those silly but fundamental questions, is something I long to have.&lt;/p&gt;
