However, I was no closer to actually debugging the error, which perplexed me. I searched every relevant function, every relevant block of code, understood how each and every parameter was being calculated, and made a mental map of how functions were being accessed and in which order. I was still stuck. And so, I decided to just scrap my current implementation, and started over.

I found that there was an error being raised in the plotting of graphs, due to a library called publib being used. Upon searching for this library, I was amazed to see that it was built by Dr. Erwan! You can have a look at it here
I initially thought nothing of the error, and was convinced that my implementation was correct.

Chapter 2: Weeks 1 and 2 Dr. Erwan let us know about the community’s plan to conduct our projects in teams of two, based on our projects’ similarities.
Thus a team between Arunava Basu and I, and a team between Tran Huu Nhat Huy and Supriya Kumari was formed.
Unfortunately, I fell sick midway through week 1. I tried to tackle smaller issues, but couldn’t focus at all.

After extensive research, I found OpenAstronomy to be quite interesting and joined the Slack channel. I was looking at the sub-organisations in OpenAstronomy, and joined their individual Slack channels as well. It was around this time that I started looking at the issues of the sub-orgs. I was very new to open-source, hence even basic stuff like issuing PR’s and tackling simple good-first-issues was challenging.
