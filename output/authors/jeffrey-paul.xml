I’d have never imagined working with SunPy as a GSoC student and here I am concluding it with the final report. Before I summarize all the 30+ pull requests I’ve made to Sunkit-Pyvista, I just want to take a moment to than the brilliant mentors I’ve gotten to work with. The were not only patient and understanding but also extremely helpful with making me understand how everything works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*SExFSpEK386SN8OQ_fOtEQ.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to Sunpy, or should I say Sunkit-Pyvista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunkit-Pyvista was created with the intention of extending Sunpy’s extensive plotting capabilities to 3D with the help of a VTK wrapper for Python — Pyvista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with either of these libraries were extremely short-lived, but over the summer I got my hands dirty with them and loved every bit of it. I would’ve never imagined me doing a project regarding astronomy or 3D plotting, but here we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original idea was proposed by one of the mentors a while and after an entire summer of working on it, I’m proud to say that I was a part of this library’s initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire project was planned out over the 10 weeks of the GSoC period and I’m pretty proud to say that we had gotten done with everything slightly ahead of time which left us a few buffer weeks for us to review code and catch some bugs. For now, majority of the plotting/visualization functionality from Sunpy has been added to Sunkit-Pyvista, and we do have plans for some pretty cool stuff later on! I’m excited to see how this project would be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here’s a list of all the significant PRs I’ve made to the library which were carefully reviewed by both my mentors before any merges happened. The entire list of all my PRs can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Every PR came with it’s own change-log and was carefully documented throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/4"&gt;Initial setup of the code written by one of the mentors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/10"&gt;Ability to set camera coordinates functionality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/12"&gt;Addition of Pfsspy field lines visualization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/17"&gt;Drawing_Quadrangle on a 3D map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/23"&gt;Unit test time!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/24"&gt;Efficient Plotting with MultiBlocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/26"&gt;Clip Interval for clipping of data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/29"&gt;Functionality to Plot tiny sphere at a given coordinate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/30"&gt;Adding in some examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jeffrey-paul2000.medium.com/feed#34"&gt;Ah, bug-fixes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/37"&gt;Saving and loading plots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/38"&gt;Figure tests are now a thing!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/52"&gt;Performance enhancements to draw_quadrangle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/55"&gt;Plot_limb from Sunpy, but in 3D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/73"&gt;Color enhancements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from these PRs, a lot more smaller ones were made which were related these significant ones in terms of enhancements or bug-fixes, but for the most part, everything is covered here. I think we’re set to have our 0.1 release right after the mentors take care of how the documentation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also planned to work on some cool &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/pull/57"&gt;animations&lt;/a&gt; using the Pyvistaqt module but this was out of the scope of the original GSoC project so we’ve put a pin in it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my work doesn’t stop here. Being one of the main developers of this project, I’d love to continue working and building on it. Here’s to the amazing folks at SunPy and GSoC for this opportunity. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;

OpenAstronomy has helped me improve the way I express myself in a satirical manner. I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what’s the plan for my future but let’s save that story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y0Rim-lsXAAtQbRuk6-37A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Here’s picture of sun and its field lines to show that I’m working on astronomy related, but actually have no proper knowledge of how any of this works, cheers! 🍻&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit of how my last week of “officially” working on Sunkit-Pyvista went :-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We put a pin on the animator as it didn’t make sense for us to work on something that isn’t of more value for the first release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pfsspy field lines now allow for a custom color function to be passed while plotting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All main functionality is big-free (as far as I know) and can be used efficiently without having to worry about something failing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The final boss with our little project is trying to get the documentation to render 3D plots correctly and this is being handled by the mentors which is a huge load off my head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it I guess, these last few PRs mark the end of the so called “GSoC” period. What more have I left out? I’ve spoken about everything there is to be said, we’re nearing the end of this pretty interesting journey that I had embarked on. Other than a small bit of sadness, I’ve got nothing else to say. I’ve decided to continue working on Sunkit-Pyvista as being an open-sourced contributor is all about the community and I’m doing my part in working towards that (It’s not like I was planning on leaving either way though, this is almost a part of my daily routine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to Sunpy and the best mentors I’ve interacted with. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=e9ce2f5de6dc" width="1"&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/08/20210816_0320_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 02:20:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Balance</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210730_1925_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*6vTTZ8HC33kEpYk0Wr8gxg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Cosmic Balance” — completely unrelated type of balance to what I go on to talk to talk about in this post. Although, outer space looks all fancy and it goes well with the theme of OpenAstronomy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From all my previous posts, it is quite evident that I obsess over small and insignificant details, mainly directed towards how my life is going to be in the future and this entire concept of “happiness”. However, the past few months of working with Sunpy has brought about this odd sense of calm. The entire feeling of stress being an emotion goes out the window. Maybe this is what doing something you love, maybe it’s the people — or maybe it’s just extremely good timing combined with coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, I suppose these questions don’t have simple answers. Regardless, whatever I’m doing with right now has restored that balance that I was longing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to what has been happening with sunkit-pyvista. To summarize, I spent an entire week fixing things that I caused due to over-confidence :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I think I’m nearing the end of this project. A few bits of functionality has to be added in but for the most part, I think it’s all in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saving and loading entire scenes are now possible with the work that we’ve done. This took quite a bit of time and it was pretty interesting to see how we could extend functionality to such massive extents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We uncovered a few hidden issues that may have occurred because of me. Ones such as ill-defined tests because I may have been slightly over-confident with how I write code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite a bit of time was spent resolving these issues, but I can definitely conclude that it was well worth the effort and I certainly learnt my lesson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure tests are now a thing, we drew some parallels with Pyvista’s code and structured our own figure testing methodology which makes it easier for us to visually identify any mishaps in our plots. After all, we’re creating a library for data visualization. It’d be sad if our code tests pass and we’re under the assumption that everything is working fine (yet another dig at myself for not writing efficient tests).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can safely say that Sunkit-Pyvista is quite balanced and usable now, or at least I hope so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to how this might be the last few PRs of this project under the whole “GSoC timeline”, this makes me both sad and happy. It’s saddening to see that something I worked towards for over 6 months has kind of come to an end. Happy because I’ve gotten to work with some of the best developers and I genuinely enjoyed every bit of it. This offsets the balance in my life, but I think we may have a solution to this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=239840d26318" width="1"&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210730_1925_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:25:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Not just Python.</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210710_1254_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;h4&gt;Not just Python&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunkit-Pyvista is doing quite well as of today, this goes without saying due to the fact the the Sunpy developers put in quite a bit of effort into reading all the stuff that I write and they do carefully review them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’ve personally faced no a few issues with getting things to work as they are. I don’t have much to say about this project except the fact that I’m super stoked about it and it has been going super well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to write code from scratch that’s turned into an actual project that would help someone, I also get to learn stuff that I never saw myself doing. From tinkering around with CircleCI to getting documentation to work the way we want them to, this project seems like the ideal one for a python developer like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize what happened over the past few weeks —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve gotten over most of the project and we’re now working towards the initial stuff we put a pin in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic plotting functionality of Sunpy now exists with Sunkit-Pyvista.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We moved the documentation over to GitHub workflows and I’m hoping that we get it to work by the end of the month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve introduced animations as a new feature to our work and we’ve got some ideas with how to take this forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having no prior experience with Astrophysics, I decided to give Stephen Hawking’s “The Theory of Everything” a read. (Well, not a read, I prefer listening to audio books even though they are inferior). Revisiting physics with an astronomical sense gave me such a new perspective on what I am doing and fueled the motivation to continue the project with the same excitement I began with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zrsJJIzLw4FexpUa1-SAUw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regardless of it not actually looking like this — it still is fascinating, isn’t it?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I never saw myself voluntarily taking an interest in astrophysics or open source software, but here I am today, doing both of them simultaneously. Who knows what the future holds for me, I’ve always been anxious about that. At times like these I try to think of how this universe is so nondeterministic, we may have a few guesses and theories as to why things happen the way it does but, we can’t say for sure. This thought grounds my thoughts and I suddenly stop worrying about everything, for sometime at-least…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=ef21d76e0152" width="1"&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/07/20210710_1254_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 11:54:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rotation and Coordinates</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210622_0048_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, the official “coding period” of &lt;strong&gt;GSoC&lt;/strong&gt; finally began a couple of days ago. From where we started of with Sunkit-Pyvista, to where we are today makes me feel a tad bit happy! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/985/1*-X2tw67TTrMoj3F43QS0uA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks 1 and 2 were initially set out for me to complete adding rotation functionality to the library, which started off great, but ended up causing some confusion 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was quickly sorted out and we went with not having to implement rotation functionality and moved on, learning that not everything will go according to plan and it’s okay for stuff to not work out at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the work that I had set out to do was completed well and it was all smooth sailing from then on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We worked on implementing the setting of the initial camera position from Astropy’s Skycoord.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few 2D methods were converted to it’s 3D counter part to be used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit tests for the implemented methods were added as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/225/0*alo7nZjT7uTO6BzJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mid-level solar flare, observed on Jan. 12, 2015.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m don’t know the first thing when it comes to astrophysics or astronomy, I do know that there is some pretty cool stuff going on out there though! I may not know what that is, but there’s a small sense of satisfaction in knowing that maybe whatever I’m doing is going to help someone out there do their work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=1c9683c38461" width="1"&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210622_0048_jeffreypaul15/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 23:48:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Summer with SunPy ☀️</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2021/06/20210603_0834_jeffreypaul15/</link><dc:creator>Jeffrey Paul</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I was introduced to the world of open source by a few peers of mine and despite having the many unanswered questions about why open source software exists, eventually I decided to try my hand at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I had mentioned how I’d continue to be a contributor to SunPy regardless of the outcome of GSOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I made a promise to myself that regardless of the outcome of my proposal, I will continue to contribute to this organization that taught me so much.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, this showed up a couple of weeks later :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*WnrYxkGo8nkbdKoDz-xCAA.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out things went my way and this gave me the motivation I was lacking for this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my project is quite simple actually. &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt; allows for visualization of spatially-aware data by means of Map objects. These objects have extensive 2D visualization capabilities for plotting various coordinate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibility will be experimenting and tinkering around with these visualization capabilities and converting them into 3D with some extra added functionality! Seems pretty cool right? Well, it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what I’d be doing :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/191/1*QlX4LmZXc7e_C96fL-qHRA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Converting this&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/917/1*Omv0aIRFxR7VR9F6ruIBaQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;To this!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project involves using &lt;strong&gt;Pyvista&lt;/strong&gt;, a python api for using the Visualization Toolkit. The entire project is part of a separate package affiliated with SunPy and you can find it &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-pyvista/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first 2 weeks with SunPy went great! It involved learning and tinkering around with &lt;strong&gt;Sphinx &lt;/strong&gt;for documentation which I had never used before, figuring out what goes where and how it happens was pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve finally decided on how we’d go about producing unit tests for these plots, we uncovered an issue with &lt;strong&gt;PyVista &lt;/strong&gt;as well. The project mentors and I had a few discussions on how to render these 3D plots for display in our documentation, how this would impact the continuous integration builds as our current one seemed to be having a few issues with &lt;strong&gt;XVFB&lt;/strong&gt; server and displaying the plots correctly. These issues are yet to be fixed and a concrete solution is to be decided on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few pull requests with the initial code to set up the package and provide basic plotting functionality was merged in and the package finally produces a 3D plot for any map in &lt;strong&gt;Sunpy&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marked the end of the community bonding phase of the project and in the coming weeks, I’ll be working on experimenting with rotation and &lt;strong&gt;AstroPy’s SkyCoord&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll also be working on some plotting field lines from &lt;strong&gt;PfssPy&lt;/strong&gt; which would add some extra functionality to the library. I’ve finally gotten into getting my hands dirty with the code and I’m loving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much it for the first fortnight with &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt;, looking forward to see how this project turns out, everything seems to be going well and I’m grateful to be working on this project with my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
