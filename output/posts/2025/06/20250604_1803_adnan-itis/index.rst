    <p>Wow! I still can't believe I'm actually in Google Summer of Code! This was a dream, and now here I am, officially past the Community Bonding Period and diving headfirst into the Coding Phase.</p>
    <p><b>Whatâ€™s Happening Right Now?</b></p>
    <p>Right now, Iâ€™m sketching out the basic structure of the application interface. The first big task? Fetching event files from specific sources. Sounds simple, right? Wellâ€¦ not quite</p>
    <!-- TEASER_END -->
    <p>Turns out, HEASARC (the database I need) is having a little meltdown (donâ€™t we all sometimes?). So while I wait for it to get its act together, Iâ€™ve been tweaking the pipeline thatâ€™ll handle the data retrieval.</p>
    <p>Oh, and my mentor dropped a fun suggestion: "Hey, why not try running this on SciServer?" So guess what Iâ€™ll be wrestling with next?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The last two weeks were chaos. My end-semester exams decided to crash the party right in the middle of the Community Bonding Period. Juggling study sessions, meeting my mentors, and trying not to panic about code I hadnâ€™t even written yet? Yeah, that wasâ€¦ an experience.</p>
    <p>But I survived! And soon, Iâ€™ll spill all the tea in a proper "How I Got Into GSoC" postâ€”complete with:</p>
    <p>Why I chose Stingray <b>(spoiler: space data is cool)</b></p>
    <p>The emotional rollercoaster of the application process</p>
    <p>Why I may or may not have happy-cried when I got accepted</p>
    <p><b><br /></b></p>
    <p><b>Whatâ€™s Next? Big Dreams &amp; Messy Code</b></p>
    <p>Iâ€™ve got so many ideas for this project, and the best part? Weâ€™re still figuring things out as we go. Itâ€™s like exploring uncharted territoryâ€”sometimes you hit a wall, sometimes you find a hidden shortcut, but itâ€™s always an adventure.</p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>This is my very first GSoC blog, and honestly? Iâ€™m just excited to share the journeyâ€”bugs, breakthroughs, and all. Thanks for reading! More updates coming soon. ðŸš€ :})</p>
