&lt;h3 id="community-bonding-period"&gt;Community Bonding Period&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the euphoria of being accepted into GSoC faded, it was time for setting up my workspace and diving back into the codebase after a month. Planning out the project was key, and meeting with my mentors was a big part of that. I was excited for this chat because the mentors had been super helpful and easy to reach during the proposal stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h3 id="setting-the-stage-mentor-meet-up-and-project-planning"&gt;Setting the Stage: Mentor Meet-Up and Project Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meet-up, we discussed about the best approach to kick-start the development process. It was mostly the mentors discussing about the possible roadmap and as they outlined the project roadmap, I listened carefully, taking notes on important discussions. One of the key decision was to set up clear communication channels and workflows to make sure we all stay on the same page and to ensure I do not vary off of the project or get stuck in a deadend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we agreed to use GitHub projects for project management, making it easier to keep track of tasks and monitor progress. You can check out the GitHub project here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/sunpy/projects/12/views/1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from discussing the project proceedings, I was also tasked with setting up a blog website to document my GSoC journey and share updates with the community. I decided to use Hugo to create the blog website and deployed it through GitHub pages. Additionally, I was asked to share the RSS feed of my blog to ensure that project updates are easily accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://viciouseagle03.github.io/images/tasks.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="week-01-first-coding-week"&gt;Week [01]: First Coding Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-brief-overview-about-my-project"&gt;A brief overview about my project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My projects aims to enable the storage and retrieval of NDCube objects using the ASDF file format. Currently, ndcube lacks native support for saving NDCube objects to files and loading them back, limiting its usability. To address this, the project will implement convertors and schema definitions for NDCube objects and related classes ensuring robust serialization and deserialiazation. The first phase of my project requires the complete imlementation of serialization of an &lt;strong&gt;ndcube.NDCube&lt;/strong&gt; object when &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; is a numpy array and &lt;code&gt;.wcs&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;gwcs.WCS object&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-prototype"&gt;The Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our meeting, we discussed the initial steps, which centered around laying the groundwork for serialization support for the NDCube object, particularly focusing on establishing basic functionality. This included implementing the convertor class, registering the convertors as ASDF extensions, and ensuring they were readily available via entry points. Getting a good grasp of the whole serialization process took some dedicated reading through the ASDF docs 🧐.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convertor Class: I implemented the convertor class, including the &lt;code&gt;to_yaml_tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from_yaml_tree&lt;/code&gt; methods. The former converts NDCube object attributes into a single node object suitable for serialization. Now, here’s the super cool part the &lt;code&gt;.wcs&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the NDCube object, being a complex object, is accommodated within the node, as the node is permitted to contain nested complex objects.
&lt;em&gt;Viola!&lt;/em&gt; , so I was able to leverage the existing convertor for GWCS objects which made the process somewhat less complicated. The latter method is exactly the opposite, it accepts a single node object from parsed YAML and returns the corresponding NDCube object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schema and Manifests: The Schema was designed to validate the presence, and the datatype of the validator properties for the NDCube object. The manifest was implemented for acheiving the resource mapping of the schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASDF Integration: In entry_point.py, I’ve implemented get_resource_mapping to retrieve mappings for schema and manifest files, required for ASDF file validation and identifying NDCube objects and the get_extension is implemented to retrieve extensions , here the extension through which the ndcube convertor was registered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="code-demonstration"&gt;Code Demonstration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ndcube-initialised-with-gwcswcs-object-as-its-wcs-attribute"&gt;NDCube initialised with gwcs.WCS object as its ‘.wcs’ attribute&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-this-series-about"&gt;What is this series about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog posts, I mainly plan on walking you through what it was like working for GSoC, what challenges I faced, and how I overcame those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="img" src="https://viciouseagle03.github.io/images/GSoC_OA.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="discovering-gsoc-from-curiosity-to-decision"&gt;Discovering GSoC: From Curiosity to Decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across Google Summer of Code (GSoC) during my early years at IIT Roorkee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of working on real-world open source projects with guidance from experienced mentors worldwide piqued my interest.
For me it provided a unique chance to collaborate with an international community of developers, enhancing my skills in coding, problem-solving, and project management. I was amazed by the idea of jumping into a library that so many people were part of really got me excited. Getting to help out and knowing it would make a difference for loads of folks - it resonated with me :) . So, I went on a hunt for an organisation that matched my skills and also kept me engaged enough to persistently work on the project idea throughout the summers ☀️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="proposal-a-daunting-task"&gt;Proposal: A Daunting Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had chosen the organization and tackled some issues, opened a few pull requests, and familiarized myself with the codebase, the next step was to explore the idea list. Based on my interest, I chose NDCube (open-source SunPy affiliated package). I went through the tests and documentation to understand the NDCube package better and chose the &lt;strong&gt;Serialization of NDCube Classes to ASDF&lt;/strong&gt; project. Crafting the proposal was a challenge, I had to keep it concise, sticking to the recommended 5-page limit. With the support of the SunPy mentors, who provided valuable feedback, I was able to refine my proposal to meet the standards expected by GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-ndcube-package"&gt;The NDCube package&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://viciouseagle03.github.io/images/ndcube.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us understand what really is the ndcube package, it is a Python package used for managing multi-dimensional data in astronomy. In astronomy, data often comes in arrays with multiple dimensions, such as images or spectroscopic data cubes. Each element of the array represents a measurement taken at a specific point in space and time.
The challenge lies in managing the relationship between the array elements data and their corresponding physical locations in the observed sky. This is where the World Coordinate System (WCS) framework comes in. WCS provides a standardized way to relate array axes to physical coordinates(connects points in the image to their real locations in space).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine you have lots of pictures, each showing a different part of the sky or taken at a different time. It would be great if you could combine all these pictures into one big map, right? That’s where ndcube comes in. It’s like a tool that takes all these pictures and their coordinate information and puts them together in a way that makes them easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ndcube, you can slice these pictures, zoom in on specific regions, or compare different pictures side by side. You can also transform the coordinates, which is like moving your map from one location to another or rotating it to see things from a different angle. And the best part is, ndcube does all this while keeping track of the complex coordinate transformations of data points. As ndcube puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental reason to opt for ndcube is to harness the astronomy-specific World Coordinate System (WCS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-waiting-game-from-submission-to-selection"&gt;The Waiting Game: From Submission to Selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a month of anticipation, the long-awaited email arrived from the GSoC team: my proposal had been accepted by OpenAstronomy(The umbrella organization) 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://viciouseagle03.github.io/images/Acceptance.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into GSoC is super exciting and it marks the start of an amazing journey. I know it’s going to take a lot of hard work and dedication, but I’m really looking forward to the challenges ahead and most importantly, the incredible learning experience that GSoC brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentors overseeing my project are &lt;a href="https://github.com/DanRyanIrish"&gt;Daniel Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cadair"&gt;Stuart Mumford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/braingram"&gt;Brett Graham&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on writing the next post within a week or two, documenting the progress I make in the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/06/20240607_1041_viciouseagle03/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 09:41:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Have to serve multiple apps with panel</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/06/20240605_1706_kartikmandar/</link><dc:creator>Kartik Mandar</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt; So I am not able to find out why panel has to serve multiple apps.  Why can't I just serve single app and work from there and open any other python file from there. How would I get a app based architectures! &lt;br&gt;And I could make my files for particular functionalities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also how could I get stateless behaviour from panel is also a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Manit Singh, and I’m thrilled to share my journey as a participant in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with SunPy. Getting selected for this prestigious program has been a significant milestone in my career, and I am excited to contribute to the Enhancing SOAR Metadata project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Bonding Period&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction to the Community Bonding Period&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community bonding period was an essential phase where I got to know my mentors, understand the project’s goals in-depth, and prepare for the coding period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meetings and Discussions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, I had several meetings and discussions with my mentors and community members. These interactions were crucial for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding the Project Goals: The project aims to increase the scope of SOAR data in sunpy-soar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarifying Initial Approaches: My initial approach was to implement wavelength and detector first, and then discuss the implementation of the next set of metadata.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From these initial discussions, we concluded that the Detector should be implemented first, after creating methods to support the joining of instrument and data tables (i.e., v_&amp;lt;instrument&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;ll/sc&amp;gt;_fits and v_&amp;lt;ll/sc&amp;gt;_data_item).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First Coding Week: Implementing the Detector in the SOAR Project&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary objective for the first week was to add methods to support querying data involving instrument and data tables both and implement the detector component in the SOAR project. Although the detector is part of the SOAR product, my mentors suggested that there are many people who might still want to query over the detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the meetings held during the community bonding period, I worked on constructing methods to enable joining two different tables. Initially, it all looked very messy, but with time and refactoring, a quite simple join constructing method was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implementing Detector: Similar to how other metadata in the sunpy.net attribute system was implemented, I implemented the Detector. The only major difference was taking data from two tables and joining them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing: I added tests to ensure that the construct method designed for joining tables could give the desired query outputs and that the detector was working fine for instruments with multiple dimensional data. (which depends on the dimensional index).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges and Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Different Dimension Index for instruments:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instruments collect a wide variety of data types that can be multidimensional. For example, for SPICE, there are 4 dimensions, resulting in 4 similar rows of data, one for each dimension. This could be confusing for the user unless the dimension index is also shown in a column. For the STIX instrument, there are 0 dimensions, meaning it does not have any detector column in its instrument fits table. For other remote sensing instruments, there are 2 dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# As there are no dimensions in STIX, the dimension index need not be included in the query for STIX.&lt;br&gt;if "stx" not in instrument_table:&lt;br&gt;# To avoid duplicate rows in the output table, the dimension index is set to 1.&lt;br&gt;final_query += "h2.dimension_index='1'+AND+"&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the construct methods of the ADQL query I added dimension_index to be taken 1 by default for all instruments other than STIX, this results in no repetition of data.&lt;br&gt;For STIX instrument, since there are no dimension it just works simply okay without taking any dimension in the join query constructed after construct methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;instrument = a.Instrument("METIS")&lt;br&gt;time = a.Time("2022-06-02 0:00","2022-06-02 1:00")&lt;br&gt;level = a.Level(2)&lt;br&gt;detector=a.Detector("VLD")&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ek6niIkxBvp0a6AqSrAivw.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the first week, the detector component was successfully implemented in sunpy-soar. The pull request is currently awaiting review from all the mentors to ensure any discrepancies in the implementation are addressed and to gather additional insights. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey so far has been incredibly enriching. The support from my mentors and the community has been invaluable. I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks and continuing to contribute to the SOAR project.&lt;/p&gt;

If you think you can have it all in one day, you are wrong. Even if you are eating just one grain of that pizza per day, it still counts. I am not saying that you should work less, I am saying one should aspire to work everyday no matter how less or more it is. Because some days you just, just can't do what you had planned to. In those days you can't just go on a disheartening streak and go on a bad spiral. You just gotta believe that in the long run you will get it done. It's very easy to say this, but man doing one thing everyday when you are not able to see much progress is hard. fucking hard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I will reach the end, I am certainly hoping too and I want everyone else to be hopeful too.

I know I could have done more preparation but I am not too sad with the results. I was able to show my mentors a basic beginning of the layout. I am using the holoviz ecosystem to make the dashboard. The base is panel itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went through many of the tutorials and came to realise it is quite suitable to what we need from the dashboard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing this project is not say for example an extremely challenging or difficult problem/job. It's mostly a problem of consistency working on smaller issues and try to get hold of the bigger picture and be consistent in doing your work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am excited to strive for the best and fulfil not only my mentors expectations but my own expectations with myself. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
First 2 weeks summarize:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I began working on refactoring &lt;code&gt;hek.py&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;br&gt;
I started by migrating the finished work in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/7059"&gt;GSoC2023&lt;/a&gt; to a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/7619"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; to start working on it.&lt;br&gt;
My first contribution was creating &lt;code&gt;util.py&lt;/code&gt; file to include all utility functions needed for &lt;code&gt;hek.py&lt;/code&gt;, a lot of functions that was added in HEKClient at first didn't make sense to remain there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the new &lt;code&gt;util.py&lt;/code&gt; file includes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_values_to_quantities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_columns_to_table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_coord_prop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_coord_prop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_chaincode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_unit&lt;/code&gt; has been simplified in terms of implementation and interface, this was the first version:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;is_coord_prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord1_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;coord2_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;coord3_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;[, ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# deg
&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span class="n"&gt;coord1_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;coord2_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord1_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord2_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord1_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord2_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord3_unit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coord_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;unit_prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first thing that has been done is to use unit aliases inside the function using context manager instead of putting the aliases globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole goal of this function is to parse a string into an astropy unit, but the big part of the function was splitting the string into more than one unit if the input was coordinate units, and then returning the unit assigned to &lt;code&gt;unit_prop&lt;/code&gt;. I decided to just remove all of this and convert the unit into an array and return the first index, like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;units&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;[, ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And actually it works just fine with all HEK features and events, so I will keep it like this until some strange error appears.&lt;br&gt;
And also the interface has been simplified to just take the string of the targeted unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the current version of &lt;code&gt;get_unit&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;
Converts string into astropy unit.

Parameters
----------
unit: str
The targeted unit

Returns
-------
unit
Astropy unit object (e.g. &amp;lt;class &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;astropy.units.core.Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;class &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;astropy.units.core.CompositeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;gt;)

Raises
------
ValueError
Because `unit` did not parse as unit.

&lt;span class="n"&gt;aliases&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;steradian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_enabled_units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cm2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;set_enabled_aliases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;aliases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If they are units of coordinates, it will have more than one unit,
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# otherwise it will be just one unit.
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# NOTE: There is an assumption that coord1_unit, coord2_unit and coord3_unit will be the same.
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;units&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;[, ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another thing that has been done was adding a documentation string for &lt;code&gt;parse_chaincode&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse_chaincode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sh"&gt;"""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;
Parses a string representation of coordinates and convert them into a PolygonSkyRegion object
using units based on the specified coordinate frame.

Parameters
----------
value: PolygonSkyRegion
A polygon defined using vertices in sky coordinates.
attribute: dict
An object from coord_properties.json
unit: str
The unit of the coordinates

Returns
-------
PolygonSkyRegion
A polygon defined using vertices in sky coordinates.

Raises
------
IndexError
Because `value` does not contain the expected &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; substrings.
UnitConversionError
Because the units set by `coord1_unit` or `coord2_unit` are incompatible with the values being assigned.
