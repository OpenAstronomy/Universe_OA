I have a GSoC project with Radis</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2025/06/20250607_0949_prtm2110/</link><dc:creator>Pratham</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have been contributing to scientific open source for about a year now and it has taught me a lot I mean a lot, I still remember searching for a simple documentation issue so I could get it merged and call myself a “contributor” haha, and that got me started in scientific open source. Since then, I have been able to make some truly meaningful contributions to many projects, and here I am writing a blog for GSoC with Radis which is a pythonic library for fast line-by-line code for high resolution infrared molecular spectra, under the OpenAstronomy umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my project is cool ngl, and it is titled “Fast Parsing of Large Databases and Execution Bottlenecks” basically there exists a large highly compressed CO₂ spectroscopic database of size 6 GB file that decompresses to about 50 GB and takes at least 2.5 hours to parse and convert into a DataFrame. As you might expect, my project is about significantly reducing the parsing time and finding a workaround for storing only the “necessary” parts of the decompressed file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radis is pythonic and sometimes python gets real slow if not used the way it is meant to be used, so my initial thought was to first clean up the existing code and use vectorised operations and with numba we should be able to see some real optimisation. But then I realized the current implementation already has the right vectorized operations on DataFrames, and Pandas’ vectorized methods are already implemented in optimized C/Cython loops. So there isn’t much more to do here other than replace a few overheads with other operations. After that, as discussed with my mentors I can use a C++ Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) mechanism to parse the file and create a python interface on top of that with pybind11 or cython and other option but this will cost us portability as compilation will be a thing that is to considered. Other approach which is using vulkan API in python as it supports CPU as well GPU parallelism and its cross platform as it will works on all CPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was profile the hit2df function for the NO₂ molecule, which is much smaller compared to CO₂ but uses the same operations. That gave a good idea of the actual bottlenecks and where I need to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9OApPZeVUuVw2vAwSCqGQg.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Profiling of `hit2df` function for NO₂ molecule&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, most of the time is spent in post_process_hitran_data and which is expected because this function calls parse_local_quanta and parse_global_quanta both applies regex across multiple string columns, which is slow at scale, so I switced to fixed‐width slicing to avoid that per-row overhead, of course this was possible as the dataset is consistent and doesn’t require regex at all (I really hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4T1gkGX-4N4_CzO3"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resulted in a clean improvement of about 38%, which will serve as the default option, along with the Vulkan-API mechanism, which I expect will yield a huge optimization compared to the default. That’s something we will see that in the next episode, stay tuned ;)&lt;/p&gt;

That announcement day was pretty intense, my mind was racing, second-guessing everything. But wow, things worked out even better than I’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community bonding period hit right during my final exams, which was tricky timing. So I focused on what mattered most, getting to know my mentors, joining the weekly calls, and really wrapping my head around the project from a theoretical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What I’m Working On&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working on something called “&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Spectra for RADIS.&lt;/strong&gt;” Basically, RADIS is this awesome library for modeling rovibrational spectra, but it’s missing one key piece; electronic transitions. That’s where I come in! I want to add that missing functionality and make RADIS even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I already knew RADIS pretty well, I spent time going through everything again to make sure I really understood what needed to be done. No point in reinventing the wheel, right? My mentor Nicolas helped me put together a solid plan that actually makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breaking It Down&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I’m breaking it down into four main chunks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is &lt;strong&gt;OH Electronic Spectra Calculation&lt;/strong&gt; — I’m starting with OH molecules as my test case and building the ability to manually tweak electronic band intensities when things are not in equilibrium as suggested by Nicolas in the project idea, “&lt;em&gt;starting with non-equilibrium spectra of atomic species makes sense since the physics is slightly easier than for molecules&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes &lt;strong&gt;Electronic Temperature Support&lt;/strong&gt; — this is where I’ll add calculations for electronic state populations, assuming the electronic temperature is different from the other temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third is &lt;strong&gt;Equilibrium OH Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt; — putting together everything from the earlier steps to calculate OH spectra when things are in equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Extension to ExoMol Molecules&lt;/strong&gt; — taking what I’ve built and making it work for all ExoMol molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach builds on what RADIS already does well while systematically adding the electronic transition stuff, all within the GSoC timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Technical Stuff&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Working with Data Files&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pTN3jp3K2szObHXmSYp3gw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sample of the OH .states file format showing electronic state information and quantum numbers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To kick off the first milestone, I’m using the .states file from ExoMol for OH molecules, which has all the electronic state info and quantum numbers. RADIS already has a read_states() function in exomolapi.py that can parse this format, but right now it only extracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;i: State counting number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;E: State energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;g: State degeneracy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;J: Total angular momentum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll modify this to additionally extract the electronic-specific parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;State: Electronic state label (e.g., X(²Π))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Λ: Electronic angular momentum quantum number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Σ: Spin angular momentum quantum number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ω: Total electronic angular momentum quantum number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type: State type (e.g., Ma for main)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be the foundation for getting electronic transitions working in RADIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making the Calculations Work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the population calculations, I’ll be working with the existing partfunc.py file. I'm planning to create a new ElectronicPartitionFunction class and implement the Boltzmann distribution for electronic states. Nicolas referenced a formula from his &lt;a href="https://theses.fr/2020UPAST052"&gt;thesis (Chapter 1, Section 1.1)&lt;/a&gt; that’s relevant to what I’m implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Boltzmann distribution" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bEtk5kQGqpD5kbzwgmLeCQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Boltzmann distribution&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this will eventually get integrated into SpectrumFactory to compute electronic spectra in SpectrumFactory.non_eq_spectrum(). I'll be adding an electronic temperature (Telec) parameter and thinking about using the overpopulation parameter for manually adjusting electronic band intensities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m planning to work on all this over the next few weeks to nail the first milestone. I’m genuinely excited to be part of this project and can’t wait to learn tons and build something really cool. This is going to be an amazing journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=14b98a245c55" width="1"&gt;</description><category>radis</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2025/06/20250607_0422_darshvn/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 03:22:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC 2025 Blog — Week 1: Starting the Project</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2025/06/20250605_0225_mohyware/</link><dc:creator>mohyware</dc:creator><description>&lt;h4&gt;GSoC 2025 Blog — Starting the Project&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kicking Things Off&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first weeks of GSoC were all about getting familiar with the project, understanding its current state, and laying the groundwork for upcoming work. We began by &lt;strong&gt;listing the key features&lt;/strong&gt; we plan to implement and prioritizing them based on impact and feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cleaning Up the Repo&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before diving into development, we focused on improving the current state of the codebase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filtered through existing PRs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merged those that were ready.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Closed duplicates or low-quality submissions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requested changes when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cleanup helped fix some bugs and made the repository more maintainable moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CI Enhancements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure future contributions are smoother, we improved the Continuous Integration setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added conditional CI jobs to run &lt;strong&gt;frontend or backend tests&lt;/strong&gt; only when their respective files are changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduced &lt;strong&gt;Codecov comments&lt;/strong&gt; to show coverage of newly added lines, making it easier to track test quality in PRs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes should streamline reviews and reduce unnecessary CI runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Early Contributions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also started contributing new features and improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated ExoMol and NIST databases&lt;/strong&gt; into the backend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While integrating the NIST database, I encountered a tricky error related to the RADIS package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;No databank named nist in `/home/mohy/radis.json`. Available databanks: […]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the version of RADIS in the was outdated and didn’t recognize the `nist` databank. This was fixed by upgrading RADIS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;pip install — upgrade radis&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, another error popped up related to pandas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;No such keys(s): 'future.no_silent_downcasting'&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was caused by version incompatibility, which was resolved by upgrading pandas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;pip install — upgrade pandas&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these upgrades, the databases worked correctly on the backend. The frontend integration and performance optimizations (e.g., caching) are next on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased backend test coverage&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for newly added endpoints and database integrations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a wrap for the first weeks! It’s been a productive start, and I’m excited to keep building and learning in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more updates!&lt;/p&gt;

I still can't believe I'm actually in Google Summer of Code! This was a dream, and now here I am, officially past the Community Bonding Period and diving headfirst into the Coding Phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s Happening Right Now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m sketching out the basic structure of the application interface. The first big task? Fetching event files from specific sources. Sounds simple, right? Well… not quite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, HEASARC (the database I need) is having a little meltdown (don’t we all sometimes?). So while I wait for it to get its act together, I’ve been tweaking the pipeline that’ll handle the data retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and my mentor dropped a fun suggestion: "Hey, why not try running this on SciServer?" So guess what I’ll be wrestling with next? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks were chaos. My end-semester exams decided to crash the party right in the middle of the Community Bonding Period. Juggling study sessions, meeting my mentors, and trying not to panic about code I hadn’t even written yet? Yeah, that was… an experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I survived! And soon, I’ll spill all the tea in a proper "How I Got Into GSoC" post—complete with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I chose Stingray &lt;b&gt;(spoiler: space data is cool)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional rollercoaster of the application process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I may or may not have happy-cried when I got accepted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s Next? Big Dreams &amp;amp; Messy Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got so many ideas for this project, and the best part? We’re still figuring things out as we go. It’s like exploring uncharted territory—sometimes you hit a wall, sometimes you find a hidden shortcut, but it’s always an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my very first GSoC blog, and honestly? I’m just excited to share the journey—bugs, breakthroughs, and all. Thanks for reading! More updates coming soon. 🚀 :})&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2025/06/20250604_1803_adnan-itis/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Beginning of GSoC 2025</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2025/05/20250526_1844_kashish2210/</link><dc:creator>kashish shrivastav</dc:creator><description>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to my first blog!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited to begin this journey. Since childhood, I’ve been deeply fascinated by &lt;strong&gt;astronomy&lt;/strong&gt;, and today, I finally get to express that passion through writing and sharing my learning experiences with such a great community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Memorable Start – Meeting My Mentors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week started off on a truly inspiring note. On &lt;strong&gt;May 23rd&lt;/strong&gt;, I had the opportunity to meet my mentors—individuals with deep expertise and experience in the field. At first, I was a bit nervous and hesitant. But the moment the session began, all my fear started fading away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We began with short introductions and then quickly moved on to discussing plans for the upcoming work. I had a few doubts—some of which I felt were too basic or weird to ask—but I’m so glad I did! My mentors answered them with such clarity and patience. They even gave me valuable suggestions for improving one of my current functions (called &lt;code&gt;recpiec&lt;/code&gt;) and helped us finalize a workflow to proceed with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Through Articles and Real Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the week, I spent time diving deep into articles to strengthen my understanding. One article that particularly stood out was authored by one of my mentors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aaa83b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;“No Time for Dead Time: Use the Fourier Amplitude Differences to Normalize Dead-time-affected Periodograms”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article taught me about the problem of &lt;strong&gt;dead time&lt;/strong&gt; in time-series data, especially when analyzing periodic signals using &lt;strong&gt;periodograms&lt;/strong&gt;. Dead time refers to gaps or inactive intervals in data collection, which can significantly distort frequency analysis. The article introduced a technique using &lt;strong&gt;Fourier Amplitude Differences&lt;/strong&gt; to correctly normalize these periodograms, ensuring the results remain accurate and meaningful. This method was new to me and absolutely fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/diwakerpant/bartletts-method-pp-ts-11511919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Exploring Bartlett’s Method and Hanning Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with that, I also explored &lt;strong&gt;Bartlett's method&lt;/strong&gt;—a signal processing technique used to reduce the variance of power spectral density estimates. It involves dividing the signal into non-overlapping segments, computing a periodogram for each, and averaging them. This approach provides a smoother, more reliable estimate of the spectrum, which is especially useful in noisy datasets (which are quite common in astronomy!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this, I also implemented the &lt;strong&gt;Hann window&lt;/strong&gt; in my code to taper the signal before applying spectral analysis. This windowing technique helps minimize spectral leakage by reducing the discontinuities at the edges of the signal. I was surprised to see how much of a difference it made in the clarity of results!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;


&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;









&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick snippet showing how I used the Hann window:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class="diff-table tab-size js-diff-table"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="blob-code blob-code-addition"&gt;&lt;span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker-addition"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en" style="color: #d2a8ff;"&gt;hanning&lt;/span&gt;(N&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style="background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;td class="blob-num blob-num-addition empty-cell"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="blob-num blob-num-addition"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="blob-code blob-code-addition"&gt;&lt;span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker-addition"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;cos&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;π &lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; (N&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;))) &lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1" style="color: #79c0ff;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="blob-num blob-num-addition empty-cell"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="blob-num blob-num-addition"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="blob-code blob-code-addition"&gt;&lt;span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker-addition"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k" style="color: #ff7b72;"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I have pasted the plots also to get more insights :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiv8rx6YEf03zFZgH-4NN0vtJSzohH_w6l8HwrNaTyCjmWGieJGwKVAlIixqN9GfYbOnJYApuFSskS7ccfUySGzgoJUA27FdE3nluw5pxc2aZSgdKI-8IspMORgeUwOz8gOJIVI-rv4y50Xu-CSeWj6A3mIZooPcO5FLic0Wq5P4L5kS7fDyDzDypG-Bo4v" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="347" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiv8rx6YEf03zFZgH-4NN0vtJSzohH_w6l8HwrNaTyCjmWGieJGwKVAlIixqN9GfYbOnJYApuFSskS7ccfUySGzgoJUA27FdE3nluw5pxc2aZSgdKI-8IspMORgeUwOz8gOJIVI-rv4y50Xu-CSeWj6A3mIZooPcO5FLic0Wq5P4L5kS7fDyDzDypG-Bo4v=w405-h347" width="405"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;Oh! u have read my entire blog, thank u :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>JuliaAstro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2025/05/20250526_1844_kashish2210/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 17:44:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Final GSoC Report</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/10/20241006_2230_deadspheroid/</link><dc:creator>DeadSpheroid</dc:creator><description>&lt;p class="intro"&gt;In this post, I'll be discussing my GSoC'24 project, the goals set, work done, and future scope&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects to share resources, ideas, and to improve code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAstronomy consists of many different projects: astropy, sunpy, stingray, radis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and of course GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="about-gnuastro"&gt;About Gnuastro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="center" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Gnuastro Logo" src="https://deadspheroid.github.io/my-blog/assets/img/gnu-logo.png" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 24px;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnuastro is an official GNU package that consists of many CLI programs as well as library functions for manipulation and analysis of astronomical data.
Something important to note about Gnuastro is that it is written entirely in C99 and shell script.
The Gnuastro team meets every Tuesday to exchange notes and review progress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="goals-of-the-project"&gt;Goals of the project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into this project, there were two main goals decided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up the low level wrapper infrastructure for using OpenCL within Gnuastro, putting minimal requirements on the developers/users to know OpenCL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallelizing Gnuastro subroutines using the aforementioned wrappers to offload compute-heavy tasks to the GPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first goal deals with how users of the library would interact with the OpenCL modules. Ideally, you would want the users to have no knowledge about OpenCL and only interact with it through GNUAstro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second goal deals with analyzing parts of the Gnuastro library, identifying easy to parallelize sections and writing optimised OpenCL Kernels for them, leveraging the wrapper infrastructure for execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of my work lives &lt;a href="https://github.com/DeadSpheroid/gnuastro/tree/final"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pre-gsoc"&gt;Pre GSoC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to GSoC, my experience consisted mostly of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. My knowledge of GPU Processing was limited and naive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the proposal drafting period, candidates were asked to submit a task, which was implementing simple image convolution on both CPU and GPU using OpenCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="during-gsoc"&gt;During GSoC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on GSoC kicked off around May 1st with the first objective being&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="build-system-integration"&gt;Build System Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Gnuastro being a GNU project uses the GNU Build System, GNU Autotools(Autoconf, Automake, Libtool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a completely new build system for me to work with and I had to get the library to include OpenCL and link against the OpenCL library at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to some helpful pointers from Mohammad, I was able to grasp the working pretty quickly and was able to set up Gnuastro to include and build with OpenCL if it was detected on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can read &lt;a href="https://deadspheroid.github.io/my-blog/post/GettingStarted/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="wrapper-infrastructure"&gt;Wrapper Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next goal was to create wrappers around the OpenCL C API, for various operations(data transfer, launching kernels, querying devices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was done in the form of a new Gnuastro module called &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;cl-utils.c&lt;/code&gt; which contained&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="initialisation"&gt;Initialisation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions dealing with initialising OpenCL and creating, destroying OpenCL objects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="data-transfer-functions"&gt;Data Transfer Functions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions dealing with data transfer to and from the GPU.
This is one of the biggest overheads in GPU Programming. Additionally, OpenCL presented another challenge in the form of transferring structs to the GPU, which was problematic as one of Gnuastro’s most important data structures &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gal_data_t&lt;/code&gt; could not be directly transferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this module provides two ways of transferring data to the GPU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenCL Buffers
and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenCL SVM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffers are intended to be used for simple data structures, while OpenCL SVM is better with more complex data structures involving internal pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interface looks something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;void
gal_cl_write_to_device (cl_mem *buffer, void *mapped_ptr,
cl_command_queue command_queue);

void *
gal_cl_read_to_host (cl_mem buffer, size_t size,
cl_command_queue command_queue);
.
.
.
gal_data_t *
gal_cl_alloc_svm (size_t size_of_array, size_t size_of_dsize,
cl_context context, cl_command_queue command_queue);

void
gal_cl_map_svm_to_cpu (cl_context context, cl_command_queue command_queue,
void *svm_ptr, size_t size);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on the two, and a comparison see &lt;a href="https://deadspheroid.github.io/my-blog/post/ExploringFurther/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="executing-kernels"&gt;Executing Kernels&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the main code running on the GPU is the OpenCL Kernel, usually defined in a .cl file and compiled at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea when making this module, was to keep the interface as similar to the original pthreads &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gal_threads_spin_off()&lt;/code&gt; interface that Gnuastro already had. So i created a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gal_cl_threads_spinoff()&lt;/code&gt; function, taking information like the kernel filepath, number of inputs, list of inputs, number of threads executed and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;typedef struct clprm
{
char               *kernel_path; /* Path to kernel.cl file */
char               *kernel_name; /* Name of __kernel function */
char             *compiler_opts; /* Additional compiler options */
cl_device_id          device_id; /* Device to be targeted */
cl_context              context; /* Context of OpenCL in use */
int             num_kernel_args; /* Number of total kernel arguments */
int                num_svm_args; /* Number of SVM args*/
void              **kernel_args; /* Array of pointers to kernel args */
size_t       *kernel_args_sizes; /* Sizes of non SVM args */
int          num_extra_svm_args; /* Number of implicit SVM args */
void           **extra_svm_args; /* Array of pointers to these args */
int                    work_dim; /* Work dimension of job - 1,2,3 */
size_t        *global_work_size; /* Array of global sizes of size work_dim */
size_t         *local_work_size; /* Array of local sizes of size work_dim */
} clprm;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wrappers were not developed all at once, but rather in conjunction with the next section, writing wrappers as and when I needed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="parallelized-subroutines"&gt;Parallelized Subroutines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the goal of GPU acceleration, first we needed to identify parts of the library that could be parallelized.
Its important to note that not everything can be parallelized, and just because something can be, doesnt mean it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious candidate for this of course was 2D Image Convolution, already implemented in Gnuastro in the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;astconvolve&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="same-code-on-cpu-and-gpu"&gt;Same code on CPU and GPU&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial idea was to have the exact same code running on both the CPU(via pthread) and the GPU(via OpenCL). This is possible because OpenCL Kernels are based on OpenCL C which is a variant(kind of a subset) of C99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because Gnuastro is a “minimal dependencies” package and having two separate implementations would greatly overcomplicate the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However for the time being, this idea was shelved, till I had a working implementation of convolution in OpenCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="convolution"&gt;Convolution&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to work creating a new module &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;cl-convolve.c&lt;/code&gt; containing the new implementation of convolution &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gal_convolve_cl()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact code can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/DeadSpheroid/gnuastro/blob/final/lib/cl-convolve.c"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but in short&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer input, kernel and output images to GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spin off a thread for each pixel in the input, convolving that particular pixel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the output image back to CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id="additional-features"&gt;Additional features&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Gnuastro doesn’t use a &lt;strong&gt;simple 2D convolution&lt;/strong&gt;, it also performs an additional three important tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; Pixels near the edge use a different kernel weight than others. More info &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gnuastro/manual/html_node/Edges-in-the-spatial-domain.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAN Checking:&lt;/strong&gt; Often, images captured by astronomical cameras, have missing pixels(represented as NANs). These pixels are to be ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Cameras use multiple different sensors to capture images, and convolution should not mix pixels from different sensors. For a better idea, read &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gnuastro/manual/html_node/Tessellation.html"&gt;Gnuastro’s explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two were rather easy to implement, but the third was a bit troublesome, especially because the existing implementation of gnuastro was complex and hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually however, with a little bit of math it was possible, and the final kernel looked like &lt;a href="https://github.com/DeadSpheroid/gnuastro/blob/4442a544db5d33d64290ac0b15a97bd627ad6335/bin/convolve/astconvolve-conv.cl"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these parts were completed, now, all that was left was to actually integrate it properly with Gnuastro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="optimised-convolution"&gt;Optimised Convolution&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of GPUs comes not from the many threads that are launched, but rather from the many optimisations possible, from organising threads into blocks, to special kinds of memory. I decided to try optimising Convolution based on Labeeb’s suggestion of using shared memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However most of the optimisation out there are for CUDA, not OpenCL, but the principles in question were the same. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/sjames/cs525/final.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to implement an optimised 2Dconvolution kernel in OpenCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the optimisation were surprisingly positive:
For a 5000 x 5000 image, times recorded for the convolution operation(excluding data reading/writing in seconds were)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Pthread&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;OpenCL-CPU&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;OpenCL-GPU&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;w/out optimisations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;1.014374&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0.918015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.025869&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;w/ optimisations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;1.053622&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0.326756&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.004184&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats a speedup of &lt;strong&gt;~6.2 times&lt;/strong&gt; over the non optimised GPU run, and &lt;strong&gt;~242 times&lt;/strong&gt; over the existing pthread implementation in Gnuastro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further optimisations are possible using special native functions like MUL24 and constant memory. But the details of those and how these optimisation work is a topic for a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="revisiting-same-code-on-cpu-vs-gpu"&gt;Revisiting Same Code on CPU vs GPU&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a discussion, it was decided that the best path forward for OpenCL in Gnuastro would be to completely replace the existing pthread implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the existing “convoluted” convolution implementation would be replaced with my new one, allowing the same code to be ran in 3 different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With OpenCL on the GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With OpenCL on the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With GCC+Pthreads on the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision was made to adhere to the Gnuastro philosophy of “Minimal Dependencies” so the user does not have to install many packages just to use the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was challenging, owing to the different styles in which we write code for a CPU device versus a GPU device. But I managed to get a partially working version using some C macros here and there to do so. It still fails some Gnuastro tests, which is yet to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, doing so prevents the library from utilising the full power of GPUs with several GPU specific optimisations seen previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="using-the-opencl-modules-in-your-program"&gt;Using the OpenCL modules in your program&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when a user wants to use Gnuastro’s OpenCL capabilities within their own programs, the flow followed would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intialize OpenCL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer Input to Device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an OpenCL Kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinoff Threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy Output back to Host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets take an example where we need to simply add two fits images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="initialize-opencl"&gt;Initialize OpenCl&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;  cl_context context;
cl_platform_id platform_id;
cl_device_id device_id;

gal_cl_init (CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, &amp;amp;context, &amp;amp;platform_id, &amp;amp;device_id);
cl_command_queue command_queue
= gal_cl_create_command_queue (context, device_id);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initializes and OpenCL context, among other objects for use in future function calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="transfer-input-to-device"&gt;Transfer Input to Device&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make use of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gal_cl_copy_data_to_gpu()&lt;/code&gt; to transfer the loaded fits files to the GPU, passing the previously initialized context and command queue. Make sure the command queue finishes before proceeding ahead through &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gal_cl_finish_queue()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;  gal_data_t *input_image1_gpu
= gal_cl_copy_data_to_gpu (context, command_queue, input_image1);
gal_data_t *input_image2_gpu
= gal_cl_copy_data_to_gpu (context, command_queue, input_image2);
gal_data_t *output_image_gpu
= gal_cl_copy_data_to_gpu (context, command_queue, output_image);

gal_cl_finish_queue (command_queue);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h6 id="write-an-opencl-kernel"&gt;Write an OpenCL Kernel&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, any custom structs you use, must be defined in the kernel, here we define gal_data_t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you create the “per thread” function that will be executed, prefixed by &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;__kernel&lt;/code&gt; and always returning &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the arguments, mention the pointers to the inputs/outputs, as well as a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;__global&lt;/code&gt; identifier, since your input is acessible by all threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make use of OpenCl’s &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;get_global_id(0)&lt;/code&gt; to get the thread id along the 0th dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perform the core operation of your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;typedef struct  __attribute__((aligned(4))) gal_data_t
{
/* Basic information on array of data. */
void *restrict array; /* Array keeping data elements.               */
uchar type;         /* Type of data (see 'gnuastro/type.h').      */
size_t ndim;          /* Number of dimensions in the array.         */
size_t *dsize;        /* Size of array along each dimension.        */
size_t size;          /* Total number of data-elements.             */
.
.
.
/* Pointers to other data structures. */
struct gal_data_t *next;  /* To use it as a linked list if necessary.   */
struct gal_data_t *block; /* 'gal_data_t' of hosting block, see above.  */
} gal_data_t;

__kernel void
add(__global gal_data_t *input_image1,
__global gal_data_t *input_image2,
__global gal_data_t *output_image)
{
int id = get_global_id(0);

float *input_array1 = (float *)input_image1-&amp;gt;array;
float *input_array2 = (float *)input_image2-&amp;gt;array;
float *output_array = (float *)output_image-&amp;gt;array;

output_array[id] = input_array1[id] + input_array2[id];
return;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h6 id="spin-off-threads"&gt;Spin Off Threads&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make use of the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;clprm&lt;/code&gt; struct defined in &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;gnuastro/cl-utils.h&lt;/code&gt; to group all the relevant parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Kernel Path&lt;/code&gt; is the filepath to the OpenCL Kernel you just wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Kernel Name&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the function you defined with &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;__kernel&lt;/code&gt; earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Compiler Options&lt;/code&gt; is a string of any special compiler options like macros/debug options you wish to use for the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Device Id &amp;amp; Context&lt;/code&gt; are the objects intialized in the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Number of Kernel Arguments&lt;/code&gt; is the number of kernel arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Number of SVM Arguments&lt;/code&gt; is the number of arguments that use SVM(all the gal_data_t’s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Kernel Arguments&lt;/code&gt; is an array to void pointers of kernel arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Number of Extra SVM Arguments&lt;/code&gt; is the number of arguments that are implicitly referenced with a struct. For example, &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;input_image1_gpu&lt;/code&gt; is directly referenced as a kernel argument, but the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;input_image1_gpu-&amp;gt;array&lt;/code&gt; is implicitly referenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Extra SVM Arguments&lt;/code&gt; is an array of void pointers to the aforementioned special arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Work Dim&lt;/code&gt; is the number of dimensions of the threads (1, 2, 3)
For example, an array would have 1 dimension(0,1,2,…34,35,36) x
an image would have 2 dimensions(0:0, 0:1, 1:0, 1:1,….) x:y
a volume would have 3 dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Global Work Size&lt;/code&gt; is the total number of threads spun off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;Local Work Size&lt;/code&gt; is the number of threads in a block on one GPU core. Leaving it blank lets the device choose this number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;
clprm *sprm = (clprm *)malloc (sizeof (clprm));

void *kernel_args[] = { (void *)input_image1_gpu, (void *)input_image2_gpu,
(void *)output_image_gpu };

void *svm_ptrs[]
= { (void *)input_image1_gpu-&amp;gt;array, (void *)input_image2_gpu-&amp;gt;array,
(void *)output_image_gpu-&amp;gt;array };

size_t numactions = input_image1-&amp;gt;size;

sprm-&amp;gt;kernel_path = "./lib/kernels/add.cl";
sprm-&amp;gt;kernel_name = "add";
sprm-&amp;gt;compiler_opts = "";
sprm-&amp;gt;device_id = device_id;
sprm-&amp;gt;context = context;
sprm-&amp;gt;num_kernel_args = 3;
sprm-&amp;gt;num_svm_args = 3;
sprm-&amp;gt;kernel_args = kernel_args;
sprm-&amp;gt;num_extra_svm_args = 3;
sprm-&amp;gt;extra_svm_args = svm_ptrs;
sprm-&amp;gt;work_dim = 1;
sprm-&amp;gt;global_work_size = &amp;amp;numactions;
sprm-&amp;gt;local_work_size = NULL;

gal_cl_finish_queue (command_queue);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h6 id="copy-output-back-to-host"&gt;Copy Output back to Host&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C"&gt;gal_cl_read_data_to_cpu(context, command_queue, output_image_gpu);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete program can be accessed &lt;a href="https://github.com/DeadSpheroid/gnuastro/blob/final/cl-example-add-fits.c"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="post-gsoc"&gt;Post GSoC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that the wrapper infrastructure is set up and convolution is implemented, whats left is to test the implementation against real life scenarios to make sure it lives up to the expectations of the Gnuastro users.
We also need to come up with a consistent way to execute the same kernel on both OpenCL and GCC, as mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, now that work on one module is complete, it opens the scope for more modules to be implemented on the GPU (like statistics, interpolation and more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="acknowledgements"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSoC has been an incredible learning experience for me both from a technical view and from a personal view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, I learned a lot about one of my favourite domains in Low Level Programming, GPU Programming and my understanding of how to write libraries that are easy to use, performant and above and all else, FOSS, improved tremendously. It’s one thing when you learn and write code for your own personal projects, but it’s a completely different experience contributing to something like Gnuastro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, the weekly meetings with the Gnuastro team were always extremely engaging and i got to learn a lot from the team, Giacomo’s work on Astrometry, Alvaro’s work on Deconvolution and Ronald too. Their feedback on stuff like debugging using valgrind/gdb and references to other projects using OpenCL, alongside other topics has been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above and all else im thankful to my mentor &lt;a href="https://akhlaghi.org/"&gt;Mohammad Akhlagi&lt;/a&gt;. Its been amazing getting to interact with someone so experienced and I learned a lot from him, ranging from Astronomy to Hacking the GNU C Library. He was always patient and understanding of my other responsibilities and allowed me to work at my own pace. I’m grateful to him for the opportunity to be a part of the Gnuastro community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can’t explain how indebited I am to my mentor &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/labib-asari/?originalSubdomain=in"&gt;Labeeb Asari&lt;/a&gt;. His knowledge about GPU Programming has been vital to my work on this project and I’m grateful to him for introducing me to the Gnuastro team. From &lt;a href="https://github.com/ProjectX-VJTI"&gt;Project X&lt;/a&gt;, to GSoC to college in general, he has been a big help in everything I’ve done and im glad to have him as a mentor and friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to the Google Summer of Code Team for undertaking this wonderful initiative and I hope they continue this program in future years.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gnuastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/10/20241006_2230_deadspheroid/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Concluding GSoC24</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/09/20240912_1635_lucasmg18/</link><dc:creator>Lucas Martin Garcia</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As the sun sets on the Google Summer of Code 2024, it's time to reflect on our exploration of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) light curve interpolation using advanced neural networks. Over the course of this project, we ventured into the complexities of AGN data, developing and refining models to better predict and understand the erratic behaviors of these celestial objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of the Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our journey began with the goal of enhancing the accuracy of AGN light curve predictions. We employed custom Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs), coupled with an interpretative neural network layer, aiming to leverage both past and future context in our predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In our last phase, we meticulously tested our BRNN model against traditional linear interpolation and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear Interpolation:&lt;/strong&gt; Test Loss = 1.2790908372984307e-07&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KNN Interpolation:&lt;/strong&gt; Test Loss = 1.211259949511657e-07&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRNN Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Test Loss = 7.520762018434385e-08&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the BRNN model showcased a promising improvement in test loss compared to the other methods, the enhancements, although significant, did not fully justify the computational expense and complexity involved in deploying and refining such advanced models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see the test results of the BRNN Model for an specific AGN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflections and Future Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings suggest that while the advanced BRNN model holds potential, further refinement and optimization are necessary to fully harness its capabilities in a cost-effective manner. Future explorations could focus on integrating additional data types and exploring even more complex neural network architectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This project has been a profound learning experience, not only in terms of technical development but also in understanding the intricate complexity of celestial phenomena. As GSoC24 concludes, we hope the insights gained will fuel further research and innovation in the field of astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;

I am grateful that I got the opportunity to be in GSOC and get to know the wonderful mentors Matteo and Gullo. Thank you for guiding me. Let's see what the final term evaluation beholds for me..Fingers crossed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also regardless of how the evaluation turns out to be, I am gonna continue contributing to the project as much as I can. &lt;/p&gt;

My project focussed on adding support for atomic line databases to RADIS, which has up till now catered only for molecular databases. Atomic lines differ significantly from molecular lines in how they are affected by Lorentzian broadening and how non-equilibrium spectra are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal was &lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/652"&gt;adding support for the Kurucz atomic database&lt;/a&gt;, which is now complete. This laid the basic structure for adding new atomic databases, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/689"&gt;a PR is now open for adding NIST&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of side issues have arisen throughout the course of the project and been tended to within those PRs, whereas independent issues and PRs have been opened for other issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The non-equilibrium linestrength calculation for both atoms and molecules now &lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/676"&gt;uses the Einstein Coefficient instead of the reference linestrength&lt;/a&gt;, thereby allowing weaker spectra to be seen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/issues/661"&gt;The issue was also raised&lt;/a&gt; as to whether RADIS should be automatically modifying the user config file, and if so then how. That has been tended to in the Kurucz and NIST implementation so far and could be expanded to the molecular databases too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/675"&gt;fixing the removal of ‘object’ type columns from the line dataframe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/issues/666"&gt;Debugging a docstring example that didn’t actually work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the project starting, &lt;a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/646"&gt;a PR&lt;/a&gt; was also opened to allow users to specify the minimum linestrength at which to cut off weaker lines by specifying them as the weakest x% of lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>radis</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/08/20240825_0000_code29563/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC 2024 @OpenAstronomy: Overview of Merged and Pending PRs</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2024/08/20240824_1117_viciouseagle03/</link><dc:creator>ViciousEagle03</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="img" src="https://viciouseagle03.github.io/images/PR-Merged.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="merged"&gt;(Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR for supporting the serialization of basic &lt;code&gt;ndcube.NDCube&lt;/code&gt; objects with the serialization logic written for the below classes
NDCube, GlobalCoords, ExtraCoords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id="pr-751-add-support-for-the-serialization-of-the-ndcube-wcs-wrappershttpsgithubcomsunpyndcubepull751"&gt;PR #751: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/751"&gt;Add support for the serialization of the ndcube WCS wrappers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5 id="yet-to-be-merged"&gt;(Yet to be Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This PR introduces serialization support for &lt;code&gt;ndcube&lt;/code&gt; WCS wrappers, including &lt;code&gt;CompoundLowLevelWCS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ResampledLowLevelWCS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ReorderedLowLevelWCS&lt;/code&gt;, allowing them to be saved in ASDF format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id="pr-756-add-serialization-logic-for-the-ndcubesequence-and-ndcollectionhttpsgithubcomsunpyndcubepull756"&gt;PR #756: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/756"&gt;Add serialization logic for the NDCubeSequence and NDCollection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5 id="yet-to-be-merged-1"&gt;(Yet to be Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This PR introduces serialization support for &lt;code&gt;NDCubeSequence&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NDCollection&lt;/code&gt; objects, enabling their conversion to and from ASDF format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id="merged-1"&gt;(Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This PR removes the &lt;code&gt;astropy&lt;/code&gt; version check, which was previously set to version 5.1, from the codebase. The minimum required version is updated to 5.2, and associated conditional logic in &lt;code&gt;test_transform.py&lt;/code&gt; is removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id="pr-235-support-serialization-of-astropywcswcs-objects-to-asdfhttpsgithubcomastropyasdf-astropypull235"&gt;PR #235: &lt;a href="https://github.com/astropy/asdf-astropy/pull/235"&gt;Support serialization of astropy.wcs.WCS objects to ASDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5 id="yet-to-be-merged-2"&gt;(Yet to be Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This PR introduces support for serializing &lt;code&gt;astropy.wcs.WCS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;astropy.wcs.wcsapi.SlicedLowLevelWCS&lt;/code&gt; objects to ASDF format. With this enhancement, any &lt;code&gt;ndcube.NDCube&lt;/code&gt; objects can be serialized to ASDF while preserving the underlying WCS as &lt;code&gt;astropy.wcs.WCS&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, it ensures that sliced &lt;code&gt;ndcube.NDCube&lt;/code&gt; objects maintain proper WCS preservation when serialized and are restored correctly upon deserialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id="pr-239-add-serialization-logic-for-uncertainty-objectshttpsgithubcomastropyasdf-astropypull239"&gt;PR #239: &lt;a href="https://github.com/astropy/asdf-astropy/pull/239"&gt;Add serialization logic for uncertainty objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5 id="yet-to-be-merged-3"&gt;(Yet to be Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This PR adds serialization logic for &lt;code&gt;astropy.nddata.StdDevUncertainty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;astropy.nddata.UnknownUncertainty&lt;/code&gt; objects. This update enables the serialization of these uncertainty types, ensuring that the uncertainty attribute of the &lt;code&gt;ndcube.NDCube&lt;/code&gt; object is properly preserved and restored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sunpy"&gt;SunPy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id="pr-7686-asdf-schema-update-minor-changehttpsgithubcomsunpysunpypull7686"&gt;PR #7686: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/7686"&gt;ASDF schema update: minor change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5 id="merged-2"&gt;(Merged)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This PR updates the ASDF schema by removing incorrect usage of the unsupported &lt;code&gt;allowAdditionalProperties&lt;/code&gt; validator. This minor change ensures that the schema files for generic_map (versions &lt;code&gt;1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1.1.0&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;1.2.0&lt;/code&gt;) are correctly formatted.&lt;/li&gt;
