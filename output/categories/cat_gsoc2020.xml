It can peer back into primordial times to show images of how the universe looked like around a quarter of a billion years after the Big Bang when the first stars and galaxies started to form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation, a dreaded 10-letter word(just counted the number of letters😅) that brings stress and anxiety in everyone from a small kid to a golden-ager(sounds so much better than ‘old-person’ doesn’t it!!). The Cambridge dictionary defines evaluation &lt;em&gt;(noun)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ɪˌvæl.juˈeɪ.ʃən, &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;strong&gt;“ the process of judging or calculating the quality, importance, amount, or value of something”. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Evaluations bring the best or worst out of people. I work better under pressure, I am one of those guys who cannot work until the room is on fire😂(I have a better phrase but it doesn’t quite qualify as PG-13😜).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluations although simple(the procedure) in GSoC are a big deal as they determine if you get (cue the Heavenly choir sound effect) &lt;strong&gt;the monthly stipend&lt;/strong&gt;🤑, just kidding, they determine if the student will be allowed to continue their projects. There are three &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;main &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;evaluations, one after each month to quantify if the project achieves the goals that it intended to and if the time was utilized most efficiently for the greatest possible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand procedural information is pretty boring so let’s directly jump to the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Google FooBar Challenege&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FvygSOchRZWfDLrq4QB9GQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looks like an invitation from a secret society!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened at around 9:00 am on 9th of June, I had pulled an all-nighter and was half-asleep, finding ways to optimize stingray, when on typing _________ my browser window pivoted, the above image unfolded, my eyes widened, heartbeat skyrocketed, I looked in awe at my screen and then blinked 100 times, washed my face to truly confirm what I was seeing was true. &lt;br&gt;
It was the GOOGLE FOOBAR CHALLENGE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FooBar challenge is a coveted, hidden challenge, a special invitation that is only sent to a selected few(makes me feel like James Bond😜). FooBar is Google’s secret hiring challenge. Google uses this to hire some of the best developers around the globe which they think can be a good match for their organization. &lt;br&gt;
Google sends an invitation based on one’s search history and problem-solving related keyword searches. If hidden magic in the Google search algorithm chooses you, you may receive an invitation for Google Foobar(makes me feel like Harry Potter😂).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without thinking twice I instantly clicked &lt;em&gt;‘I want to play’. &lt;/em&gt;A black screen with a command-line interface greeted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sxh-YA_0437rxf5lu4r8mA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objects we ardently pursue bring little happiness when gained; most of our pleasures come from unexpected sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FooBar challenge is essentially an online, time-bound Competitive Programming(CP) challenge with 5 rounds of increasing difficulty, each round having a different number of questions. &lt;br&gt;
To spice things up (both in terms of interest and difficulty) Google has a storyline, progressing through the challenges you are asked for a friend who you’d like to refer for the challenge and eventually some personal details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FooBar proved to be a great learning experience for me as I’m not proficient in CP. I felt that the main aim was not to test the skills and knowledge of an individual but also how quickly they could learn and implement solutions.&lt;br&gt;
To learn more about FooBar you could read this &lt;a href="https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First GSoC Evaluation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vw7I5eOtqMVRWRRLQcJKiw.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Summer of Code Dashboard a friend who I only see once every month😂😂&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first evaluations were scheduled from the June 29, 2020 — July 3, 2020. My mentor Matteo and I had finalized on two main deliverables crucial for the foundations of the project. &lt;br&gt;
1. A &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/9d7fa8a76d70df1eeb4501cb7ce701fb8e5bddf0/Benchmarks/Benchmark%20Analysis%20Report%202020%20-%20stingray.pdf"&gt;benchmark analysis report&lt;/a&gt; containing the time and memory benchmarks, profiling results for &lt;strong&gt;all the 31 functions&lt;/strong&gt;(3000+ lines of code)in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/lightcurve.py"&gt;Lightcurve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/powerspectrum.py"&gt;Powerspectrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/stingray/crossspectrum.py"&gt;Crossspectrum&lt;/a&gt;, AveragedPowerspectrum and AveragedCrossspectrum classes. &lt;br&gt;
2. Integrating &lt;a href="https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;airspeed velocity&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for benchmarking Python packages over their lifetime into stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark analysis report was a very time consuming yet possibly the most important step of the project. It singled out the functions that were causing the most delay and provided an overall estimate of the performance of stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking was performed in jupyter-notebooks. Data points of sizes ranging from 1,000(1K) to 100,000,000(100M) were used for benchmarking. For basic benchmarking, the %timeit and %memit magic commands were used. Two profilers &lt;a href="http://joerick.me/posts/2017/12/15/pyinstrument-20/"&gt;Pyinstrument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile"&gt;CProfile&lt;/a&gt; were used to profile time and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/filprofiler/"&gt;filprofiler&lt;/a&gt; was used to profile memory use. &lt;br&gt;
The results of the CProfile were saved as a &lt;em&gt;.pstats&lt;/em&gt; file which was then visualized using &lt;a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/"&gt;Snakeviz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot"&gt;gprof2dot&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a graphical viewer and call-graph respectively. &lt;br&gt;
The results of the Pyinstrument and filprofiler were saved as HTML files.&lt;br&gt;
The results of the &lt;em&gt;%timeit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;%memit&lt;/em&gt; magic commands was visualized in an interactive &lt;a href="https://plotly.com/"&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; graph in the jupyter-notebook itself and also saved as an HTML file for easier access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all of this was &lt;strong&gt;535 &lt;/strong&gt;files&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ready for analysis, compiled into a &lt;strong&gt;74-page&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/9d7fa8a76d70df1eeb4501cb7ce701fb8e5bddf0/Benchmarks/Benchmark%20Analysis%20Report%202020%20-%20stingray.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;9 &lt;/strong&gt;new GitHub issues and &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; new Pull Requests(for now, more to come soon).&lt;br&gt;
The functions causing the main slowdown i.e. &lt;em&gt;check_lightcurve, counts_err, cross_two_gtis, sort_counts, join, fourier_cross, rebin_data, rms_error, gti_border_bins, check_gtis, operation_with_other_lc and p_multitrial_from_single_trial &lt;/em&gt;were identified. These were further analyzed line-wise for deeper insights(also included in the document).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q3I5H5d6R8BEj73q7-YuAA.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These look beautiful in the picture but analyzing 535 of these is super tedious!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;airspeed velocity is a powerful tool that helps track the performance of a project over time, commit after commit. It is essentially a set of tests that can be run after every commit/change to check if the performance has been altered. It is used by numpy, scipy and astropy. The documentation is very well written(&lt;em&gt;sighs with relief&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;br&gt;
Thus, integrating airspeed velocity was &lt;em&gt;comparatively &lt;/em&gt;easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A brief personal submission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The thing I enjoy the most about GSoC is that just like most of you reading this article, I didn’t know, rather hadn’t even heard the names of all the tools I used and am probably adept at right now. &lt;br&gt;
I start working every day not knowing how to solve the task(often daunting) in front of me or what the day holds. But at the end of the day, I’m confident that I’ve learnt something new. &lt;br&gt;
This excites me and I look forward to every new day working on my GSoC project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out my repository for airspeed velocity below. There is a link on the right side that leads to a webpage which looks relatively empty at the moment, someday hopefully, it will look like &lt;a href="https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/"&gt;numpy’s asv&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200728_1932_raahul-singh/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:32:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSOC 2020: Metadata searches using Fido</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200728_1816_abhijeetmanhas/</link><dc:creator>Abhijeet Manhas</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/0*hF5ggLHngI8p-yaa"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Missed Comet NEOWISE due to annoying cloud cover in Vadodara straight for 2 weeks :(&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s the central theme of the project :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would now be possible to query clients that return metadata tables using Fido. So SunPy’s &lt;strong&gt;Fido&lt;/strong&gt; is a unified interface that allows searching and downloading solar physics data. In other words, it is a consistent and easy way to query most forms of solar physics data. It searches various archives and web services based on search attributes specified in the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunPy currently supports metadata facilities viz., JSOC Client, HEK Client, and Helio Client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunPy’s hek module is used to access the information in the &lt;strong&gt;Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase&lt;/strong&gt; (HEK). HEK helps solar and heliospheric researchers locate features and events of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Science Operations Center&lt;/strong&gt; (JSOC) supports data products from various observatories and solar physics instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they were not Fido compatible for metadata searches. PR #4358 addresses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Generic Class for metadata clients&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of methods were similar in these clients, so I made a new superclass for them. JSOC, Helio, and HEK responses now inherit BaseQueryResponseTable to ease inspecting data retrieved through their clients. The idea was to retain the old look of response tables and also support a method to show all columns if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200728_1816_abhijeetmanhas/" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/abb67aed8bc120d39e874af9ef9ab599/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/abb67aed8bc120d39e874af9ef9ab599/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deprecations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;~sunpy.net.hek.attrs.Time is deprecated since we can now use ~sunpy.net.attrs.Time for HEK queries, making it redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also deprecated ~sunpy.net.jsoc.attrs.Keys because now the response table contains all keys by default. Users can specify the column names as *args in :meth:~sunpy.net.hek.HEKResponse.show for getting an ~astropy.table.Table instance containing only those columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200728_1816_abhijeetmanhas/" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/d663f6878e23ecc59cd3f0b7cce932ef/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/d663f6878e23ecc59cd3f0b7cce932ef/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, HEKTable was renamed to HEKResponse for consistency in naming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Devguide for writing Fido Clients&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have explained how to write a simple Fido client in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4387"&gt;PR 4387&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first documentation pull request that I made in SunPy. Work is in progress for adding details of writing an “AttrWalker” and registring an “Attr” for Fido.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200728_1816_abhijeetmanhas/" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/449c51d6f6528dbb0a236344fe4a9524/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/449c51d6f6528dbb0a236344fe4a9524/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4394"&gt; PR #4394&lt;/a&gt;, which allows XRSClient to download reprocessed data for GOES Satellites. I also need to add support for this new pattern in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4321"&gt;dataretriever refactoring pull request, #4321&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also go through the discussions present in the net issues so I can fit their fixes in my project. I also suggest updates to the description of outdated issues and check if they still persist, like in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/2401"&gt;Issue #2401&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/2032"&gt;Issue #2032&lt;/a&gt; was fixed, so now helio wsdl_retriever returns the first valid taverna link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to now enter the last phase of the work period!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARPE NOCTEM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=909bda98b771" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>SunPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200728_1816_abhijeetmanhas/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:16:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Week 7 &amp; 8: Full Throttle Ahead!</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200727_1715_sahilyadav27/</link><dc:creator>Sahil Yadav</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last blog post, I was discussing about creating a MAGICEventSource and calling it inside DL1DataWriter to make HDF5 files with the CTA ML data format from the ROOT files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have integrated the MAGICEventSource to writer.py and also updated it to ctapipe v0.8.0. This code is housed at &lt;a href="https://github.com/cta-observatory/dl1-data-handler/pull/90"&gt;PR #90&lt;/a&gt;. There were a few small issues with the metadata and transformations. The current ctapipe MCHeader container has variables needed to be filled by the input file, but the ROOT file has separate RunHeaders, so we were in a dilemma as to which metadata to store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we decided to create our own MCHeader container inside the MAGICEventSource and use this to store metadata instead of using the ctapipe container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for the simtel files that have been analysed till now, the telescope pointing Alt and Az are constant and can be hardcoded when we train the deep learning models, to subtract them from the arrival direction Alt and Az. But for the ROOT files, this value is not constant so we will have to create another column into the HDF5 file and pass this value to CTLearn when training on ROOT files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also some confusion regarding the transformations applied to these Alt and Az values before dumping them to the HDF5 file. We were finally able to figure out what was going wrong with our approach, and plotted the difference between arrival direction and pointing position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/386/1*FG648RrN8nWpKPCJ04IF8g.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pointing position vs Arrival direction&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now all that is left is create the metadata container, and the MAGIC dataset to start training the CTLearn models before we start working on VERITAS data.&lt;/p&gt;

So basically I configured the Jupyter kernel to dump the logs in real-time in a log file.&lt;br&gt;
Then I created a new function that runs in a separate thread and pulls the content of the log file every 2 seconds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
Then the fetched data is sent to the front end via sockets every two seconds ONLY when the user opens the log.&lt;br&gt;
So when the user is not in the logs page the socket communication and the reading of the log file do not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;def fetch_logs(comm):&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;f = open(“log.file”, “r”)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;logs = f.read()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;comm.send({‘status’ : ‘log_fetched_success’ , ‘log’ : logs})&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;if (ipython.ev(‘shouldFetchLog’)):&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;threading.Timer(2.0,fetch_logs, [comm]).start()&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=3a522a2b89e4" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>astronomy-commons</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200727_1341_techguybiswa/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 12:41:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC 2020: glue-solar project 2.2</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200726_1213_kakirastern/</link><dc:creator>Kris Stern</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of the 2nd Coding Period of this year’s Google Summer of Code has finally arrived. I cannot help but noticed the many things I have learned/built over the past two months for both the &lt;a href="http://glueviz.org/"&gt;glue&lt;/a&gt; Graphical User Interface (GUI), as well for its solar physics plugin glue-solar. One of the tricks I have learned is writing up tests for the GUI programming I have done in the process, which is using Qt for Python to port the entire &lt;a href="https://wiki.qt.io/PySide"&gt;PySide&lt;/a&gt; module to Qt5. My main approach is quite simple: Imitate, modify, test. Since glue has a fairly well developed codebase, it is not hard to find sample code snippets within it for inspiration of new code to add. The GUI unit tests are no exception to this rule. And, I would like to use the opportunity to share the experience with more novice contributors to the software, so perhaps somehow someone else somewhere down the line will be able to benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost concern we should have regarding any type of unit testing is what we should check for functionality-wise. Let me take some code I have just written over the past few days which adds NDData (a data structure native to Astropy) support to glue and enables the loading of various types of astronomical data more readily, such as the standard FITS files. As I have discussed with my mentors via the glue-solar IRC channel, we have observed that NDData is much like laser was back in the 1960’s (e.g. as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/06/archives/developer-of-the-laser-calls-it-a-solution-seeking-a-problem.html"&gt;reported by NYTimes&lt;/a&gt; then) was a solution in search of a problem before its wider adoption by the astronomy community for LSST, DKIST and CCDProc data. Now we are in the process of integrating it into glue. The original conception of this, at least in principle, is to use the simple and fluid structure of NDData to help process for example FITS data. This is because there are no generic NDData files in existence at all. This is to facilitate the manipulation of not only the data component, but also its units, mask, uncertainty, and meta attributes, which are quite common in the handling of astronomical data (pun intended). With such a motivation in mind, we have added a nddata.py module to the glue/core/data_factories directory in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/glue-viz/glue/pull/2164"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; at glue. To complete the PR, it is standard practice to add tests where applicable, so we have added a testing module called test_nddata.py in the glue/core/data_factories/tests directory to not only serve as a routine, but also to test whether the code has been properly debugged, which caught all of the major known bugs I have inadvertently introduced to the codebase before testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI unit test I have written is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200726_1213_kakirastern/" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/ba8b2229df9cf1b5b160c70096612af9/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/ba8b2229df9cf1b5b160c70096612af9/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have studied the other tests in the same glue/core/data_factories/tests carefully before I proceed to write the code, as I have observed that the most basic test to write is to test the data loader. Of course, official docs helped me greatly as well. As for the formatted NDData factory, that would be hard to test. I will need to consult with my mentors, before deciding on whether a separate unit test for that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One takeaway I have come away with in the process is that sufficient time is needed before I could brainstorm and come up with a tangible plan to write unit tests for any established codebase, and that I should not rush through the process. This is a lesson that I will definitely keep in mind. There is no use going through the motion and not enjoying the process as I go along, not to mention the omissions that I would make otherwise without a well thought-out plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, we got a little bit of everything, analyzing, coding, and searching for feasible solutions to reach the best result. Therefore, we came up with a new feature in Poliastro's Earth module. The API may change in the future, so be aware by the time you read this. Hence, I bet you might be wondering, what's all the fuzz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now you can experiment with the new API to compute the visibility of sensors that are on board of the satellites. The FOV, field of view, the question is about meeting mission goals within the limit of a satellite sensor.
Given some parameters about the viewing satellite, the fundamental problem related to calculating the field of view is estimating how much of Earth we …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200724_0700_meuge/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC 2020: Blog 3 - Coordinates &amp; Perturbations</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200716_2011_jes24/</link><dc:creator>Jyotirmaya Shivottam</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
Progress so far...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refactor of the &lt;code&gt;coordinates&lt;/code&gt; module of EinsteinPy was completed over the last week and PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy/pull/521"&gt;#521&lt;/a&gt; was merged. With this, EinsteinPy now supports 4-Position and 4-Velocity calculations. To better reflect these additions across EinsteinPy, a few changes were also made to &lt;code&gt;einsteinpy.metric&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;einsteinpy.geodesic&lt;/code&gt; modules. All core modules of EinsteinPy are well-integrated now. As an aside, new metric and coordinate classes can now be added to the numerical side of EinsteinPy and we welcome community contributions for the same. Please refer to &lt;a href="https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy/issues/525"&gt;#525&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last blog, I had mentioned that this PR would also add support for Kerr-Schild (KS) coordinates and KS forms of the vacuum solutions. However, after discussions with my mentors, we have rejigged the schedule a bit and we are now prioritizing the implementation of Null Geodesics calculation and Radiative Transfer functionality in EinsteinPy, with the addition of KS coordinates becoming optional now. This has been put up as issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy/issues/526"&gt;#526&lt;/a&gt;, and as before, community contributions are welcome. Nonetheless, as promised, let’s discuss what KS perturbations are and why KS coordinates are so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href="http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200716_2011_jes24/#a-case-of-hard-differential-equations" class="anchor"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
A case of hard differential equations
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein's Field Equations (EFE), at their core, describe a field theory for gravity, quite similar to how Maxwell's Equations define a field theory for Electromagnetism. In Electromagnetism, electric and magnetic fields are basic physical entities, which both affect and are affected by a matter property called charge. Similarly, in GR, there is an underlying structure of spacetime, quantified by the metric tensor, which is calculated using EFE. These equations are second order, non-linear differential equations, which makes finding solutions for general matter-energy distributions rather difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, let's say, we are only interested in cases, where the deviation from a known distribution is "small", for example, when we go from a perfectly spherical body to a spheroidal body. In these cases, we can look for an approximate "perturbed" solution (metric) to this "perturbed" distribution by writing the approximate solution as

&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;gab(λ)=0gab(λ)+hab(λ)g_{ab}(\lambda) = {^0g_{ab}}(\lambda) + h_{ab}(\lambda) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
is a linear perturbation ("Linear", as

&lt;/span&gt;
). Kerr-Schild perturbations are a way of linearizing EFE or to form linearized approximation to EFE. Note that, EFE are in general, non-linear. So, these approximations usually only describe the solution till the first order and higher order corrections become necessary as systems grow in complexity. However, Kerr-Schild class of perturbations is unique as all higher order corrections vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

Kerr-Schild Perturbation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A generalized Kerr-Schild perturbation has the form:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;0gab{^0g_{ab}} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. A functional can be understood as a usual function, which outputs a number, but instead of accepting numbers as inputs, it takes in functions. Now, the form of
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;habKSh_{ab}^{KS} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
might seem arbitrary. However, there are some reasonable constraints on this form. First among them is, for
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;λ→0\lambda \to 0 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
, we must recover
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;0gab{^0g_{ab}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. Also,
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;ll &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
must be &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt; with respect to
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;0gab{^0g_{ab}} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
, i.e.
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;0gablalb=0  ⟹  gablalb=0{^0g_{ab}}l_a l_b = 0 \implies {g_{ab}}l_a l_b = 0  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span

class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span

class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. And, depending on the spacetime, there are additional properties that must be satisfied.

&lt;p&gt;Due to the strictly linear nature of KS perturbations, we obtain some nice features for the perturbed metric, that can even be linked back to the background metric,
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;0gab{^0g_{ab}} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. For example, the causality of an arbitrary vector,
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;vav^a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
is guaranteed to remain the same across
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;0gab{^0g_{ab}} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
and
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;gabg_{ab} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. This implies timelike and spacelike vectors remain timelike and spacelike, respectively, even in the perturbed spacetime. This also extends to null geodesics, meaning that the two metrics have shared light rays. This property, in particular, is incredibly useful from the perspective of my project. But a more notable property is that, KS perturbations impose a structure on the Stress-Energy Tensor,
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;TbaT_b^a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault mtight"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These properties make the KS forms of the metric particularly suited to describe vacuum solutions, on a flat underlying metric, such as Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions. In these cases, a particular set of coordinates, called the (cartesian form of) Kerr-Schild coordinates, are chosen to define
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;VV &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
and
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;ll &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. These coordinates are usually more involved than the most basic coordinate for the spacetime (such as Schwarzschild or Boyer-Lindquist Coordinates), but they have an interesting property, in that they expose the singularity structure well, with no coordinate singularities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interesting spacetimes, such as &lt;em&gt;pp&lt;/em&gt;-waves and &lt;em&gt;anti-de Sitter&lt;/em&gt; space can also be generated through KS perturbations. Not all solutions however, can be linearized to a KS form, as we only have three degrees of freedom in varying
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;VV &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
and
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;ll &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. Moreover, as is usual with perturbation techniques, it is difficult to estimate how small
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;λ\lambda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathdefault"&gt;λ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
must be, so that the approximation has sufficient accuracy. In any case, Perturbation Theory is a powerful mathematical tool, that most physicists use on a regular basis. A (surprisingly) simple and general introduction can be found at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Until next time...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am not working on KS perturbation functionality for EinsteinPy, at the moment, I have opened an issue (&lt;a href="https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy/issues/526"&gt;#526&lt;/a&gt;) for it. Addition of KS perturbed forms of metrics to EinsteinPy is relatively easy now, due to the structure of the Metric classes in &lt;code&gt;einsteinpy.metric&lt;/code&gt;. Feel free to take a look and contribute. Currently, I am working on the crux of the project - &lt;em&gt;Null Geodesics and Radiative Transfer in Kerr spacetime&lt;/em&gt;, figuring out the equations and validating them for use with SI units, with proper unit conversions. Once this is done, I will start putting them into code and hopefully, we will soon have this new functionality ready to be merged into EinsteinPy and open to people for use. I expect my next blog to be on Null Geodesics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>EinsteinPy</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200716_2011_jes24/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:11:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Week 5 &amp; 6: Half-time</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200715_0456_sahilyadav27/</link><dc:creator>Sahil Yadav</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first evaluation is successfully complete!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last blog post, I discussed adding a script to the DL1DataHandler to convert ROOT files to HDF5. But, in order to maintain symmetry with the current DL1DataWriter, we decided to instead create a MAGICEventSource from this root2hdf5 format that initializes the DL1 data container with ROOT data and then is sent to the CTAMLDataDumper to dump this data into an HDF5 file. This will be analogous to the SimTelEventSource that is currently being used for CTA data from simtel files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have been working on creating this MAGICEventSource. The basic code for the class structure is complete, and the containers are initialized correctly. All that remains now is to add some code to the DL1DataWriter and CTAMLDataDumper to accept and recognize MAGIC data and use the MAGICEventSource instead of the SimTelEventSource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EOSlgwziXKXKk76EYbnN2A.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I also adapted the generate_runlist script to create runlists specifically for MAGIC data, since the MAGICEventSource reads file masks instead of a couple of M1 and M2 files for each observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, both these changes will be pushed soon to the main repository and then we can start working on reading VERITAS data similarly as well as training MAGIC data using CTLearn models.&lt;/p&gt;

The last two weeks have been full of code reviews, code refactoring, and documenting stuff. I also helped new contributors to the SunPy to get them started. Thus I interacted more with the community this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making HEC Fido Compatible&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEC stands for &lt;strong&gt;Heliophysics Event Catalogue&lt;/strong&gt;. For your information, Heliophysics events are a large variety of phenomena that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;originate or occur on the Sun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Propagate through the interplanetary medium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interact with the geospace and planetary analogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7_zVGR8NSlvJ4vOi.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An illustration of an Heliophysics Event| Earth’s magnetic field shielding our planet from solar particles. Credit: NASA/GSFC/SVS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEC allows complex searches for events stored in indexed catalogs. SunPy has a HECClient which allows you to interface with Helio web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4358"&gt;PR #4358&lt;/a&gt; to enable Helio metadata searches with Fido (Federated Internet Data Obtainer), I made it inherit ~sunpy.net.BaseClient and overwrote a few methods for the client. New hec-specific attrs like MaxRecords, TableName, and Catalogue were defined to make _can_handle_query() work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2020/07/20200714_2212_abhijeetmanhas/" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/media/8cebddc67806c7e7130b0e70722fa975/href"&gt;https://medium.com/media/8cebddc67806c7e7130b0e70722fa975/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new class HECResponse was added to contain the responses retrieved after the search is executed. This made helio queries possible through Fido, although there are yet a lot of things that can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Updated tests for client redesign!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4321"&gt;PR #4321&lt;/a&gt; (nice number!) is a major refactoring pull request for sunpy’s dataretriever module. So far it has negative 1500 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally SUVIClient was generalized which was the toughest of its counterparts. It supports the highest number of attributes. These are `Time`, Source, Instrument, Phsyobs, Provider, Level, Wavelength, and SatelliteNumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The row data for the response table can either be contained as a dictionary or as data members of a class. A small hack made me achieve both. QueryResponseBlock was re-welcomed to the client.py. It now inherits OrderedDict and has dict values as class data members too. Passed Ordered Dictionary was used to update its self.__dict__.&lt;/p&gt;

I went through all of them and labeled them based on the submodules they are concerned with, how much I understand them, and their relevance with the GSoC project. Some of them were overlapping with things in my mind, so existing discussions on them shall be really helpful for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent time on writing the guidelines to extend Fido and how to add new sources to it, based on the redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to capturing the comet in the coming days and having an awesome second half!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARPE NOCTEM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
