    <h3><strong>Hello everyone, and welcome to my first blog!</strong></h3><p>I’m very excited to begin this journey. Since childhood, I’ve been deeply fascinated by <strong>astronomy</strong>, and today, I finally get to express that passion through writing and sharing my learning experiences with such a great community.</p><h4><strong>A Memorable Start – Meeting My Mentors</strong></h4><p>This week started off on a truly inspiring note. On <strong>May 23rd</strong>, I had the opportunity to meet my mentors—individuals with deep expertise and experience in the field. At first, I was a bit nervous and hesitant. But the moment the session began, all my fear started fading away.</p><p>We began with short introductions and then quickly moved on to discussing plans for the upcoming work. I had a few doubts—some of which I felt were too basic or weird to ask—but I’m so glad I did! My mentors answered them with such clarity and patience. They even gave me valuable suggestions for improving one of my current functions (called <code>recpiec</code>) and helped us finalize a workflow to proceed with.</p><h4><strong>Learning Through Articles and Real Research</strong></h4><p>Later in the week, I spent time diving deep into articles to strengthen my understanding. One article that particularly stood out was authored by one of my mentors:</p><p><strong><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aaa83b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">“No Time for Dead Time: Use the Fourier Amplitude Differences to Normalize Dead-time-affected Periodograms”</a></strong></p><p>This article taught me about the problem of <strong>dead time</strong> in time-series data, especially when analyzing periodic signals using <strong>periodograms</strong>. Dead time refers to gaps or inactive intervals in data collection, which can significantly distort frequency analysis. The article introduced a technique using <strong>Fourier Amplitude Differences</strong> to correctly normalize these periodograms, ensuring the results remain accurate and meaningful. This method was new to me and absolutely fascinating!</p><h4><strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/diwakerpant/bartletts-method-pp-ts-11511919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Exploring Bartlett’s Method and Hanning Windows</a></strong></h4><p>Along with that, I also explored <strong>Bartlett's method</strong>—a signal processing technique used to reduce the variance of power spectral density estimates. It involves dividing the signal into non-overlapping segments, computing a periodogram for each, and averaging them. This approach provides a smoother, more reliable estimate of the spectrum, which is especially useful in noisy datasets (which are quite common in astronomy!).</p><p>Inspired by this, I also implemented the <strong>Hann window</strong> in my code to taper the signal before applying spectral analysis. This windowing technique helps minimize spectral leakage by reducing the discontinuities at the edges of the signal. I was surprised to see how much of a difference it made in the clarity of results!</p><p>
