Currently I was making the sidebar intuitive to do all the stuff that we are planning to do from it.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a clever use of view to turn on and off when use clicks the button and importing the UI from different functions(that is different .py files). But this was an unmaintainable and unscalable approach. So now I have shifted to a class based approach and have made important classes to do the stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

It's going good, there's one hackathon going currently and its fun. &lt;/p&gt;

But I am not kind convinced in how I want to design the structure of the dashboard. Lets see how it goes. Probably by next week I will make my first commit. &lt;/p&gt;

So we can have any tasks on beeminder and it has all kinds of automations to connect with. So it doesn't do anything if you are completing the work, but if you are not doing your work on your scheduled pace then it stings you. So they charge you money from your bank account if you are not doing the work. I almost failed today but was able to complete the stuff in time to not get money deduct from me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But god it works. It's a really good tool to just stop procrastination. Because it costs you money. &lt;/p&gt;

How would I get a app based architectures! &lt;br&gt;And I could make my files for particular functionalities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also how could I get stateless behaviour from panel is also a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

If you think you can have it all in one day, you are wrong. Even if you are eating just one grain of that pizza per day, it still counts. I am not saying that you should work less, I am saying one should aspire to work everyday no matter how less or more it is. Because some days you just, just can't do what you had planned to. In those days you can't just go on a disheartening streak and go on a bad spiral. You just gotta believe that in the long run you will get it done. It's very easy to say this, but man doing one thing everyday when you are not able to see much progress is hard. fucking hard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I will reach the end, I am certainly hoping too and I want everyone else to be hopeful too.
