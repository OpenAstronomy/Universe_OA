Unfortunately, it's time
to bid adieu to the summer and have a look on what has been accomplished so far.
The CZML Extractor
This was undoubtedly the main and most time-consuming part of the project. The extractor
allows users to easily conv &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/19/2019-08-19-czml-extractor-an-overview.md/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190819_1300_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ground track plotting and Ellipsoids</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1300_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The second evaluation period has come to the end and with the end of the
program drawing ever closer, I'm happy to announce that most work on
the additional deliverables has been complete!
CZML3
I've added polylines and points (along with myriad of other dependent
properties/types). These also mar &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/08/01/2019-08-01-ground-track-plotting-and-ellipsoids.md/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/08/20190801_1300_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Moving forward with the Cesium application</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190715_1550_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like in the last couple of weeks I got to work a little in several aspects
of the project. While this didn't allow me to focus on a single feature, it allowed
me to make progress in various different areas.
Bug resolving and 2D mode
First and foremost, I got rid of a particularly frustrating  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/07/15/2019-07-15-moving-forward-with-the-cesium-application/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/07/20190715_1550_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Converting to CZML and next steps</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190630_0930_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;So the first phase of GSoC is over and with it, it's time to reflect what
has been achieved in the last couple of months.
CZML3
As I mentioned in the
last blogpost
this is a very useful library created by juanlu. After a
few patches, the library now supports most CZML properties and - as far as I c &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/30/2019-06-30-converting-to-czml-and-next-steps/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190630_0930_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Communication satellites and refactoring</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190613_1900_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Communication satellites and refactoring
Those couple of weeks were spent mainly on setting future milestones
and improving the quality of the code. In a way, Tom Cargill's famous
aphorism came to my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent
of the development time.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/06/13/2019-06-13-communication-satellites-and-refactoring/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/06/20190613_1900_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Let the coding begin</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/05/20190529_2130_sedictious/</link><dc:creator>Eleftheria Chatziargyriou</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Let the coding begin
So the bonding period is over, which means that the coding phase has officially begun.
I've already worked on some of the key features I'd like to add since my examination
period is around the corner. Hopefully, this won't slow me down and I'll keep up with
the workload.

under Open Astronomy as part of GSoC 2019. I'm hoping this blog will prove to
be interesting to those who are interested in poliastro or simply a source of
inspiration to those looking for a way to get their feet wet wi &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2019/05/13/2019-05-10-poliastro-gsoc-eleftheria/"&gt;...READ MORE...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>poliastro</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2019/05/20190513_1830_sedictious/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2019 17:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
