&lt;p&gt;It is the end of the coding period of GSoC”22. This is going to be my last blog about my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully implementing the bexvar method in Stingray (this &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/664"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;). I and my mentors decided that we can now work to add bexvar as a method to Stingra’s Lightcurve class. This was not a part of my original proposal. The bexvar() method takes lightcurve data in input parameters, so it made sense to provide this facility to users. Stingray’s Lightcurve class facilitates users to create Lightcurve objects and perform several operations useful for time series analysis on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lightcurve object is created by providing two arrays ( time and counts) as input parameters. Along with these it also has several other optional parameters specifying relevant lightcurve data. Most of these parameters are also attributes of the Lightcurve class. We knew that the Lightcurve class does not have parameters like frac_exp (fractional exposer in each bin),bg_counts (background counts in each bin) and bg_ratio (background ratio in each bin) which are optional parameters of bexvar(). So to add bexvar() a method to theLightcurve class, we also included these parameters in theLightcurve class and declared them as its attributes. I started the work with this &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/669"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;. However, just adding these parameters was not enough. The Lightcurve class provides some important filtering and sorting methods for Lightcurve objects. These methods did not support these optional parameters as they weren't there initially. It wouldn’t be so great if users create a Lightcurve object with all these parameters, then they may want to truncate the lightcurve or sort it or apply GTIs (Good time intervals) before calling bexvar() and the returned Lightcurve does not have these attributes. We worked on providing support for these new parameters in some of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, the bexvar() method works on the light curves with uneven sampling. Which led us to also investigate if Stingray supports the creation of such lightcurve objects. We found that the support was not very great for such data. While there was no restriction for creating a Lightcurve class with the time resolution parameter dt being an array, many methods of the Lightcurve class did not extend support for such data. We started working on providing this support after that. This led to some serious bug fixing and restless nights but finally, we were able to reach at a point where all of the existing tests are passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, I also created a jupiter notebook for a tutorial on the bexvar()method (see this &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks/pull/58"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;). This contains examples showcasing how to use the implemented method and also a section on the theoretical explanation of bexvar. This notebook will also be upgraded with examples of how to call bexvar() method implemented in the Lightcurve class once that work is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

You can check out my final report for this project containing rigorous details at this &lt;a href="https://mihirtripathi97.github.io/GSoC-22/"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;. I will continue working with Stingray, I will continue contributing to OpenAstrnomy and other open source projects as well. I must say that GSoC has been really great it provided me the best opportunity for the beginning of my journey in the open source community. I would like to thank the &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/"&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/a&gt; organization for giving me this wonderful opportunity to contribute to open source projects for the Astrophysics community. This means a lot to me as I am one of the users of several projects of the member organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank both my mentors &lt;a href="https://github.com/matteobachetti"&gt;Matteo Bachetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhuppenkothen"&gt;Daniela Huppenkothen&lt;/a&gt; for being extremely generous, supportive, and motivating mentors. I am truly grateful to have you both as my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting with aimless contributions brought me to a project which united my two passions: programming and astrophysics. The three-month journey and the community bonding period were excellent learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From learning a new and robust language like Julia to using Unit Testing for real-world data, I learned a lot about programming. This period also tested my git skills (as open source is one of the best ways to get your hands dirty in it) as I resolved merge conflicts, changed branch heads whenever required, and always kept an eye on the log history. My whole project is presented here in terms of git commits and some explanation of what these are doing. In the end, I will point out what’s next from here, and I hope Stingray will grow up to become a beloved package like many others in the Julia Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the project in 5PRs (three merged and two open to review), which are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/Stingray.jl/pull/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implement Workflow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Merged)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/Stingray.jl/pull/2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add Fourier methods and tests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Merged)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/Stingray.jl/pull/3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implement GTI Reading and Handling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Merged)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/Stingray.jl/pull/7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implement EventList&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Open)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/Stingray.jl/pull/9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Open)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also documented this journey in four other blogs: &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@aman_p/gsoc-blog-0-8f65bf844cd8"&gt;Blog0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@aman_p/gsoc-blog-1-cc0c0995d56e"&gt;Blog1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@aman_p/gsoc-blog-2-63d283e1a60b"&gt;Blog2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@aman_p/gsoc-blog-3-350c7b7dad61"&gt;and Blog3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a package from scratch can look like a behemoth task; you can confuse which methods to begin with, what the architecture will be, and how I will ensure continuous testing. Fortunately, my mentors were very helpful, and in the community bonding period itself, I initialized a basic package with the help of PkgTemplate.jl with integrated CIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mentor &lt;a href="https://github.com/matteobachetti"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matteo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested I go on to implement Fourier methods first as they are the primary thing required to create power and cross-spectra from an array. I started on with it, and the PR was a great lesson both in terms of how much code I needed to port with passing tests and how idiomatic I had to keep it to discover the full power of Julia. My initial code was pretty pythonic, and my other mentor, &lt;a href="https://github.com/giordano"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mosè&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, gave much good advice on how to fix them and keep the code readable. Still, due to the sheer amount of code and tests I needed to write, the code is currently non-idiomatic for a few functions, and I hope to make them efficient in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, I needed a working tool to handle GTIs; trust me; this was the best part of the project. I was having fun with different interval operations I needed to implement, looking at them from different angles and maintaining the code’s sanctity. The tests passed, and I had pretty idiomatic code written there with handling file reading (HDF5 and FITS) for some tests, which helped me in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mid-evals, I got somewhat busy due to tests and college courses. After the first week, I started contributing again by considering different ways to represent photon arrival and count data. Using structs and methods for them (including extending Base functions when required) was the way to go, and after half of the second phase, I managed to get a PR on these things though the code is still in review. One can now plot the LightCurves, read data from a FITS file and use the Fourier methods to get the power and cross-spectra and perform operations on the related GTIs. But how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final week, my focus was to provide documentation on the functions mentioned, taking help from the Python package and changing it as required, especially as the markdowns are different for both languages’ docstrings. I followed it with writing a user guide, although it is still incomplete in the current PR, and I hope to get it done well by the end of this month (working outside of GSoC :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, this project was exciting to me. I can safely say that I lacked experience in many parts, but my mentors were fantastic, and I had some great discussions with them. The essential power of Julia is how it handles memory and compiles the code as required (JIT), and with this in focus, the project can still grow to various extents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, good use of type systems in the Fourier methods, a clearer way to use generators (the resumable functions), and user APIs for Cross and Power Spectra would be the first thing this package needs working on. After this, we can implement other features like Bi-Spectra and Var-Energy Spectra. In the end, one can see how powerful Julia can be if programmed correctly. Below is the runtime for reading the same files in Python and Julia (Julia is doing almost 40 times faster). This order of speed boost is still an excellent achievement for Julia while keeping all the important arrays and metadata from the file in a struct.&lt;/p&gt;

Great thanks to my mentors, Open Astronomy and Google for providing this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

As I mentioned in the last blog I was completely new to software testing. This meant a lot of new things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I am going to write about my experience with testing. This was one of the best learning experiences of my GSoC journey so far. With the help of my mentors, I arrived at the conclusion that primarily there are three kinds of tests that would be needed for bexvar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Unit tests to check if various components of my code provide the correct outputs individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Some functional tests to check if the entire bexvar() function works properly and gives the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Some other tests to check if proper warnings and errors are raised in the case of bad inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the unit tests. Creating the unit tests for internal functions was comparatively easy. Two of the three internal functions provided deterministic outputs. All that was needed for testing them was to calculate the desired output and compare it with the output from the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major problems arose while designing functional tests. The bexvar() function returns an array that contains the samples of the log of the bexvar (i.e. log(\sigma_{count rate})). These samples are proportional to the posterior distribution of log(\sigma_\{count rate}). These samples are generated by an MCMC generator and therefore the elements and the number of elements of the output array are different after each run for the same data. This makes testing the result more difficult as the elements of the array could not be compared with a predetermined result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bexvar() aims to provide the posterior distribution of log(Sigma_\{count rate}) the elements as individuals do not matter but the shape of their histogram provides the posterior distribution. Therefore we decided to test the results with some statistical parameters derived from the generated samples which quantify the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems that I faced while designing the third type of test, helped me find and resolve multiple unseen issues with the code. It took me more time than I expected to complete the testing phase. However, I am glad to announce that the all tests are now passing successfully. Additionally, I also passed the mid-term evaluations! Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At end of the testing phase, The &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/664"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; was ready to be merged, after a few minor updates in the docstrings it was merged! Yaay! The work is not yet done though. Next, I am working to add a method to Stingray’s lightcurve class. In addition to this, I will be creating a tutorial page for using the bexvar and will also make some more improvements in the code if time permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=9d1572ac43ef" width="1"&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2022/08/20220826_1631_mihirtripathi97/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:31:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC Blog #3</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2022/08/20220820_0702_aman-pandey-afk/</link><dc:creator>AMAN PANDEY</dc:creator><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*dfjiDfMcY8h9eEOySAnxbA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid Evaluations are over, and I’m glad to be back at work. As the base functionality is done now, I am on to provide user APIs to create cross spectra and periodograms from actual astronomical data easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was busy the first week after the mid-term due to intern season at my campus, so that I couldn’t contribute much. Afterward, I started by understanding different functionalities related to photon count events next week. The plan was to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the photon count data from different file formats and get the essential information like time, GTIs, PI channels, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create EventList struct and handle different methods like sorting, joining, filtering, and simulating these data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test these methods by appropriately re-binning, creating periodograms, and plotting the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also modification in the git workflow as the documentation branch was based on the gti one, which now has its parent main.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 3rd week, I have worked on the EventList APIs and the data reading part. Its currently implemented for the FITS extension, but I will expand to other formats like HDF5 or ECSV. I have also studied LightCurve structure and implemented a to and from conversion with EventLists, although its methods are needed to be worked upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, I aim to create extensive tests, debug these methods, and optimize them in Julia. After these are done, other features like coherence and time lags will also be necessary. The period will &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; with documentation and refactoring of already existing codes, and &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; I get time, I will work on variability vs. energy spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=350c7b7dad61" width="1"&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2022/08/20220820_0702_aman-pandey-afk/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 06:02:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC Blog#2</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2022/07/20220726_0559_aman-pandey-afk/</link><dc:creator>AMAN PANDEY</dc:creator><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*dfjiDfMcY8h9eEOySAnxbA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first half of the coding period is almost done, and here I am with the updates! As stated at the end of the last blog, I started the 3rd week by improving the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/Stingray.jl/pull/2"&gt;second PR&lt;/a&gt;. I performed pretty intensive memory and performance analysis on the functions in fourier.jl, using BenchmarkTools and .mem files to analyze bottlenecks in the program. With my mentors’ help, I removed many allocation and type-stability related issues during that time. I also had some problems with non-idiomatic code, like I could use multiple-dispatch or dot broadcast in functions, some of which I solved, and some are due for refactoring after the mid-evaluation. After finishing the improvements and getting my second PR merged, I planned to work on LightCurves and implement periodograms and other APIs so that users can easily manipulate photon count data. But my mentor suggested I implement file reading and mechanisms to manage the GTIs (Good Time Intervals) obtained from these files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working out the GTI mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had learned a lot from the previous PR, and one of the things was I should try to implement some of the methods in my way rather than using the python algorithms with an idiomatic Julian code in mind. I started the 4th week with methods for reading GTIs from a FITS file (For those unfamiliar, it is a file format for storing, processing, and transmitting scientific data, especially images). I used the FITSIO.jl package, and experimenting on the terminal led me to manipulate HDUs and their data. One thing I thoroughly thought of was the appropriate data structure of the GTIs. Should I use Intervals from the Intervals.jl package? Or a vector of vector like the python library does? I finally decided to use what I was using in the fourier.jl, an AbstractMatrix of Reals. It was easy to access data from them, and you could use slices to get a list of start and end times. For the operations, I had to convert among matrix, intervals frequently, and vectors as the Intervals.jl provided many ways to manipulate GTIs like union or intersection or getting its complement, i.e., Bad Time Intervals. With some more methods like creating masks and GTIs from conditions and implementing Tests for all of these functions, I was finished with the gti.jl file. A little performance analysis told me that the code was efficient. After some refactoring, like removing code duplication by merging union and intersection in the same function, I was done with the PR. It has some minor changes currently to be made before it gets merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working on the documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lbM1DS0_-Ja0lb53Owb6PQ.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the mid evaluations have begun this week, I will be taking some time to write the docstring and deploy them on GitHub. The stingray python docs are pretty good, so I will mostly use them as a Base and tweak them as necessary (when there is a different function signature or the Julian way of doing things is different). Documenter.jl will be the package I would be using for this. The complete documentation will be a milestone for the end of the program, where I, along with my mentors, will try to write notebook tutorials for the package and host them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the second phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to qualify for the mid-evals, after which the second phase will begin. The core implementation is done; users can now use the library and its different methods to read from a file, process the data, and create periodograms. The main motive now will be to ease its access and implement other helpful features, a major one of which will be plotting the periodograms. I initially proposed working with these APIs before mid-evals, but who knows about the future? I have done some things meant for the other half, so I guess it’s okay. As an end note, I am pretty much excited for the other half of this program, it has made me learn a lot, and the workings of Julia awe-inspire me as I explore it side by side. Goodbye for now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to write a blog about my experience in the coding period so far. So here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official coding period for GSoC’22 started on the 13th of June. After discussing with mentors I decided that the first task would be to create a base structure of the code for Bexvar. As the method was already implemented by Dr. Johannes Buchner (who also suggested implementing this method in Stingray)and David Bogensberger, we decided to use this &lt;a href="https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/bexvar"&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first 2–3 days planning the structure of the code and planning its implementation in Stingray’s code base. At first, the implementation seemed easy. Although as I explored more and discussed my ideas with my mentors I realized that there are many small but important changes that need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, I realized that I had to set up a proper environment on my computer to write, edit and test the codes that I write. I decided to use &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; (VS Code) for it. Before the contribution period, I had only a little familiarity with Github and had never used git in my local system. I somehow made it through the contribution period without installing it. Now since I had an open source project at hand which will require frequent commits, I decided to install git and GitHub desktop on my computer and learn to use git with CLI. I found out that along with many useful tools for professional programming, VS Code also provided support to use git inside from the editor, this seemed quite useful for my purpose. I learned how to install and work with multiple versions of Python. I learned how to set up a Python virtual environment and use it to test codes in a controlled environment. I had to go through multiple iterations of installing, uninstalling, and then reinstalling several packages to set everything perfectly. This made me a bit irritated but later on, I realized that this helped me save a lot of time while coding for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through a few iterations the base code was ready and working. It still needed some improvements and structural changes. It had a core function that reads the light curve data from an AstroPy table. After that, it would call internal functions successively to finally obtain the Bayesian Excess Variance of count rate. My mentor Prof. Matteo suggested that I start a PR with this version of the code. As I made this &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/664"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;, we started discussing how to improve the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mentors pointed out that my core function &lt;em&gt;bexvar()&lt;/em&gt; needed further modularization. We decided to separate it into two functions, A core function &lt;em&gt;bexvar()&lt;/em&gt; which will accept light curve data as a set of NumPy arrays or lists and calculate bexvar, and a &lt;em&gt;bexvar_from_table()&lt;/em&gt; function which can read light curve data from an AstroPy table and call &lt;em&gt;bexvar()&lt;/em&gt;. This change made the core &lt;em&gt;bexvar()&lt;/em&gt; function more general as now users would not need to have light curve data in form of an AstroPy Table object to obtain bexvar. Also, in the future, we can create a function like &lt;em&gt;bexvar_from_table()&lt;/em&gt; which can read data from Stingray’s Lightcurve object and call &lt;em&gt;bexvar()&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase, I updated existing docstrings, added docstrings where it was missing, and worked on code formating. At this stage, the code was still failing in Stingray’s CI tests. The reason behind the failures was that the code uses an integrator &lt;a href="https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/_modules/ultranest/integrator.html#ReactiveNestedSampler"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ReactiveNestedSampler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09604"&gt;UltraNest — a robust, general purpose Bayesian inference engine&lt;/a&gt;. UltraNest is not a required dependency for Stingray, hence CI tests were failing with import error. To resolve this, the import statement of UltraNest in bexvar.py needed to be moved inside a try-except statement. This would restrict the user from using bexvar.py if UltraNest is not installed. With this change, the code has passed the majority of CI tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall experience of the coding period so far has been good. During this period I learned a lot about the essentials of open-source programming. I am learning to think like a programmer. I learned how small improvements in code make it more general and versatile. I learned about the best practices to write code. I must say that all this time my mentors Matteo and Daniela have been quite supportive and helpful. They have patiently listened to my queries and doubts and have always helped me with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code is running perfectly now, from this week onwards I will be focussing on writing tests for the code. Writing tests for a code is a completely new experience for me. I am looking forward to learn a lot about professional code testing in the following weeks. I will soon be back with a blog on my experience with testing. Till then take care! Goodbye!&lt;/p&gt;

It has been about 15 days since I had written my last blog. It is time for the next one. In this blog, I will write about my experience in GSoC so far. I want to tell you about how I selected my project, how I prepared my project proposal, and what did I do after getting selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I select the organization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s start from the beginning! I started considering to apply in GSoC in late February. I first came to know about GSoC just a few months back. My knowledge about GSoC and open-source was quite limited. One of the first things that I did was to go through the &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"&gt;GSoC website&lt;/a&gt; and learn more about the program. Being a beginner in the open-source community and also coming from a non-CS background I had no idea which organizations take part in GSoC and which of them would be most suitable for me. At this time, the mentoring organizations for GSoC”22 were not announced. I decided to check out mentoring organizations from past programs to get an idea. I wanted to work on a project that involve Physics or Astrophysics, and to my surprise, several such organizations did take part in previous programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this search, I got to know about &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/"&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/a&gt;. It is an umbrella organization of several open-source astronomy and astrophysics projects. From their &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/"&gt;GSoC webpage&lt;/a&gt;, I came to know that they are applying to participate in GSoC”22. The webpage also contained guidelines for contributors, a list of project ideas for this year and for past years, and information about how to get in touch with mentors and communities of various member organizations. All these were quite informative and useful. I also checked out several other organizations as well. All of them had such information available online in various forms. A few days later the participating organizations were announced by GSoC and OpenAstronomy was one of them. By this time, as directed in contributor guidelines of both &lt;a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/"&gt;GSoC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/student_guidelines.html"&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/a&gt;, I had introduced myself in chat channels and mailing lists of some organizations. I went through various project ideas proposed by these organizations and tried to find a project that aligned most with my interests. Being an astronomer, I wanted to work on an OpenAstronomy project and from the list of project ideas I liked the project called ‘Bexvar in Stingray’. So I decided to prepare a proposal for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you in brief about &lt;a href="https://docs.stingray.science/index.html"&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt; and ‘Bexvar’ first. Stingray is an open-source package for x-ray spectral timing written in python. It provides a number of tools to perform times series analysis and related tasks on astronomical light curves. In the case of faint x-ray sources, observed near the detection limits of telescopes, uncertainties in their light curves are dominated by Poissonian uncertainties. The Bayesian excess variance (Bexvar) method is useful to find variability intrinsic to sources from gappy light curves dominated by Poissonian uncertainties. It was developed by &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14529"&gt;Buchner et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt;. The aim of the ‘Bexvar in Stingray’ project is to implement this method in Stingray, create test cases for the method based on real observational data and write appropriate documentation. I will write about the project in more detail in my next blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I make the proposal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read about the project, my first instinct was to read the article by &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14529"&gt;Buchner et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt; to know more about the method. After reading it I was convinced that I do want to work on implementing this method in Stingray. I started by introducing myself to the Stingray community through their slack channel. As per the &lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/student_guidelines.html"&gt;guideline&lt;/a&gt; by OpenAstronmy, one of the first things to do then was to make a PR in Stingray for the contribution period. For this, I went to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; of the core Stingray package. I went through the list of open issues and found issues labeled ‘good first issue’ and ‘GSoC’. I selected an issue that I thought was closely related to my project. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/issues/592"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was about a bug in the CrossCorrelation class in stingray. The CrossCorrelation class of stingray has an internal method called time_shift. This provided the timeshift required between two lightcurves to get maximum cross-correlation between them. It was found that if two identical lightcurves are used then, the time_shift method should give zero as the answer irrespective of the length of the lightcurve. As the light curve will have maximum crosscorrelation with itself. However, the method did not give zero as an answer in the case of the light curve having an even number of time bins. I tried to solve this issue by changing how time_shift was calculated in the code. During this time I interacted with Prof. Matteo Bachetti, who is one of the mentors for the project. Before applying for GSoC, I had negligible experience in contributing to open-source. Matteo guided me a lot during this phase and finally, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/647"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; was merged. To be honest this made me very happy! It was the first time when I actually made some contributions to open-source software. The next task was to prepare a proposal for the project. This was a long and tough process. I spent most of my time reading about the Bexvar method, trying to understand it, and figuring out how to write a proposal for its implementation. During this time I sent my draft proposals to Matteo, he guided me to make them better, I worked on his suggestion. This interaction also gave me a lot of insight into what is expected from a contributor. This entire experience of preparing a proposal for the project and taking suggestions from mentors was quite new to me, and I am really grateful that I had a chance to go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*YFXjL3Wc5EqBE9vaXPHNBQ.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community bonding period&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a month of submitting a proposal, the selected proposals were announced. To my surprise, my proposal was selected. I was over the moon, I was happy, I was excited and also a little bit worried. With the selection, the three-week-long community bonding period started. This period is dedicated for selected contributors to bond with community members, and mentors, interact with them and get themselves familiar with the codebase. This acts as a warm-up period before the actual coding period starts. The first important thing that happened during this period was the project kickoff meeting with my mentors Matteo and Daniela. This was the first time when I virtually met both of them. We discussed a bit about the project, our background, and current work, our expectations from each other, etc. We decided to meet every week virtually and stay in contact during the week via slack. This was a truly nice experience for me, both of them are quite supportive, they explained things to me nicely and most importantly made me feel welcome in the community and made sure that I was comfortable. In the following weeks, I spent my time studying the implementation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/bexvar"&gt;Bexvar&lt;/a&gt; by Buchner et al. (2021), learning about Bayesian statistics, and also understanding Stingray’s code base. I also learned more about testing in python and by the end of the community bonding period, I was ready to start coding. I planned to get a basic model of the method ready in the first few weeks after the community bonding period. Overall the community bonding period was great, It really helped me get into the right mindset for the coding period and be prepared for it. I learned a lot about Stingray, Bayesian statistics, and my project during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot more is yet to be covered. Right now I am on the 3 rd week of the coding period. I will soon write about my project and my work in the coding period in detail in my next blog. It is time to wrap this one up for now. See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=7ed5a47bec65" width="1"&gt;</description><category>stingray</category><guid>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2022/07/20220704_0357_mihirtripathi97/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 02:57:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC Blog #1</title><link>http://openastronomy.org/Universe_OA/posts/2022/07/20220702_0631_aman-pandey-afk/</link><dc:creator>AMAN PANDEY</dc:creator><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/0*kmysU0LzpIzm8qV4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its time for my first blog during the coding period! We are into our 3rd week in the coding period, and already the journey is getting exciting, a little challenging, of course, but I am enjoying it. As I had mentioned in the earlier blog, I started the initial week with implementing the helper functions, Fourier analysis, and tests related to them from Python to Julia. By god, it was not an easy way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by understanding what the functions inside fourier.py did and quickly realized that without running tests, I would have a hard time working out the insides of some of the methods. I thus, started writing functions is Julia, understanding the parameters and their types and using external packages like ResumableFunctions or Statistics wherever necessary. After implementing normalizations for arrays, I worked on tests where the problems began. Out of Index errors, types not supported, and the same functionality implemented differently in Julia and Python started to take most of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to create a histogram, we use &lt;em&gt;NumPy.histogram, &lt;/em&gt;pass it an array and number of bins, and it returns the required histogram in a tuple. For Julia, I had to use the package StatsBase, then call fit(Histogram, array, bins), which generates an object whose weight property is my result. But that is the fun. I’m slowly adjusting to handling such codes without class methods, which will be very necessary for this and the next week, as I look forward to implementing LightCurves and EventLists classes of the python package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data handling, which I thought initially to be challenging, was although a smooth experience. Using the DataFrame package with the MetaData package turned out to be a very flexible approach while working with tables. I quickly implemented a large sample data using the HDF5 format suggested by my mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making the PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to complete this work when the government made the internet in my area inaccessible due to local protests. I couldn’t work that efficiently for three days and definitely couldn’t communicate with my mentor. After the internet was back, I quickly sorted out some issues and made a PR, but it wasn’t too good to be merged due to a few reasons. I didn’t provide type-annotations on the functions as many arguments were nothing (null in Julia), and providing types on them would cause the function to produce an error. My code also had some memory allocation and performance issues. The most encouraging thing was how my mentor Mosè cooperated with these issues. He advised me on many things, provided me with quick fixes, and commented on learning from these mistakes. I am certainly looking to fix these problems as soon as possible, learning along to write practical and high-performance Julia code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly changed the code to be type annotated as I already knew about the types while understanding the codebase. There were not many type instabilities as I already had checked my functions with @code_warntype macro, and it was mostly clean. The main problem I’m facing now is unlike Python, Julia doesn’t have a tradition of defaulting values with null and checking if it’s null to provide more functionality ahead in code. This is the result of one of my @code_warntype runs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nVtVLI6OIUyMQ9TqlIbqtQ.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Yellow Colour Indicates a type-instability, though it maybe important to use Unions of Nothing and a Concrete Datatype, thus it is only a warning (not red)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code is not entirely Julian, and the tests take slightly longer to run compared to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/840/1*dJ7COYI3hPgd-O3OYiv65w.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Python tests run in 3.9s on avg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next two weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to implement creating and working with LightCurves and then move on to EventLists and implement related helper functions and filters. My approach now will be to understand and sketch the functioning with a thorough working of tests and then implement it from scratch in a Julian way. Alongside, I will be improving the fourier.jl functions with what I learn and hope to get the PR merged by the start of the following week. I will be back with some more accounts of this exciting journey!&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Mihir and I am a contributor for &lt;strong&gt;Google Summer of Code 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. This blog is the first in a series of blogs where I will write about my journey through the GSoC working for &lt;a href="https://stingray.science/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stingray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under the umbrella organization&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://openastronomy.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the period of the next 12 weeks or so, I will be working toward implementing the Bayesian Excess Variance method in Stingray with help of my mentors Matteo and Daniela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are here then you might already know about the Google Summer of Code. If you do not then here is a brief description of it. It is a program, organized and conducted by Google annually. It starts somewhere around the winter equinox and ends sometime around the autumn equinox, i.e. throughout the summer. The program aims to bring new contributors to open-source software development. Of course, you can get more information about it by visiting its &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is my first blog, I will keep things simple and just write briefly about myself. By profession, I am a researcher and an educator. I did my post-graduation in Physics from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai. My research work is in the field of Star and exoplanet formation. I study the evolution and dynamics of circumstellar disks that form around young stars. Apart from this, I teach physics to undergrad students. I like to slow travel and sometimes I volunteer as a teacher and an artist. I like to read fiction and watch movies. Currently, I am staying in a small village, located amid the snow-covered mountains of the Himalayas. Here is a picture of myself, taken after a small mountain hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EVZL88BNmc_mAz_ViXDw4g.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love to code, and I love Astrophysics. There had been multiple moments in my life when I had to choose between Physics and Computer Science, and every time I wished that I can choose both. For my research work, I extensively use open-source packages like Astropy, CASA, etc. This motivated me to contribute to open-source packages for astronomy and give something back to the community. Surprisingly, this year GSoC also relaxed its eligibility criteria for contributors. All of these have brought me this serendipitous point in my life when I have an opportunity to start my journey in open-source, writing code for software used for Astrophysics while participating in a prestigious program like GSoC! So this is like a dream come true for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I will wrap up this blog for now! I plan to write about my project ‘Bayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) in Stingray’ soon in this series. If you want to know a little bit about it now, you can take a look at this &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/rG1XqJqK"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;. Till then goodbye :)!&lt;/p&gt;

It will be an exciting journey, and I will be documenting my experience and work in a series of blogs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;strong&gt;Aman Pandey, &lt;/strong&gt;and this blog is about my introduction to open source and learning Julia that lead me to take part in the Google Summer of Code for Open Astronomy, juliaAstro and Stingray to be specific. I also enlist my community bonding period work and what I intend to do next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*dfjiDfMcY8h9eEOySAnxbA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My journey to Open Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/310/1*6cUCFKPtaiyl4vQ3Q1YkLA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My intro to the open-source world was through a game called TwilioQuest. It had a level where I had to configure git and GitHub and then contribute to their Open Pixel Art repo by changing a JSON file. It was fun, but I wasn’t fully aware of the open-source community until I started understanding the Godot engine ( A 3D game engine in C++). I followed the instructions for compiling it on Windows using VSCode, but I met an issue. I couldn’t reproduce the instructions of the doc and created a pull request to change the docs when I found the solution. The community was very helpful, and after some suggestions, I could finally merge my first PR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the internet, I learned about GSoC as a program to foster an open-source culture among students, especially to guide newcomers to contribute code and engage with the community. I started searching for organizations that interested me and found OpenAstronomy (I was fascinated by the different projects going on in the organization). A thorough search made me sure to start learning Julia to contribute to the “Spectral Timing in Julia” project. While trying to contribute, I was fascinated by the structure of a Julia program and its excellent features like multiple dispatch and Abstract and Concrete Type System. Part of it was due to the incredible guidance by one of the project’s mentors, &lt;strong&gt;Mosè Giordano, &lt;/strong&gt;which shows the role of community while developing open-source software. I was thrilled when my project was announced as selected; it will be a great summer this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Bonding Period&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project involves porting the Stingray package of python to Julia, which consists of different time series analysis methods to deal with periodicities in X-Ray signals coming from massive celestial objects. I started the period by learning about different methods implemented in the python package like creating periodograms, normalizing them, and using them for data types like NumPy iterables or custom objects like LightCurves and EventLists. At the same time, I focused on learning about Julia and its best practices and understanding how to write clean, high-performance, and documented code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I committed my first PR for the project by initializing the package and adding documentation and continuous integration (CI) support. I then looked forward to porting the fourier.py file and implementing tests alongside it and was reasonably successful in it. In my opinion, it was a significant period; I discussed many exciting things with the mentors, like using DataFrames and generating distribution to test the periodograms with array inputs. I myself worked on writing type-stable code (which I was introduced to while working on a PR for another juliaAstro package, AstroLib) and diving deep into topics like dispatch and type systems, which are the testament that open source contribution can enhance your developer skills multi-folds as these topics are not restricted to any specific programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of type-unstable function :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;function foo()&lt;br&gt;    x = 1&lt;br&gt;    for i = 1:10&lt;br&gt;        x /= rand()&lt;br&gt;    end&lt;br&gt;    return x&lt;br&gt;end&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to implement the utility functions and fourier.py file of Stingray in Julia to create periodograms and cross spectra from tables. Then, I will move on to implement the light curves and event lists, through which, in the future, I will be able to create full-fledged periodograms and cross-spectra. Proper Testing and performance-related aspects will be sincerely followed throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited about this summer and expect to learn much about software development, open-source, and the programming community throughout this journey. Thanks to Google, Open Astronomy, juliaAstro, Stingray, and my mentors &lt;a href="https://github.com/matteobachetti"&gt;Matteo Bachetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/giordano"&gt;Mosè Giordano&lt;/a&gt; for providing me this opportunity. Let the coding phase start!&lt;/p&gt;
